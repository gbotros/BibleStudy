Then Job answered: 
“Even today my complaint is still bitter; his hand is heavy despite my groaning. 
O that I knew where I might find him, that I could come to his place of residence! 
I would lay out my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments. 
I would know with what words he would answer me and understand what he would say to me.
Would he contend with me with great power? No, he would only pay attention to me. 
There an upright person could present his case before him, and I would be delivered forever from my judge. 
“If I go to the east, he is not there, and to the west, yet I do not perceive him.
In the north when he is at work, I do not see him; when he turns to the south, I see no trace of him.
But he knows the pathway that I take; if he tested me, I would come forth like gold. 
My feet have followed his steps closely; I have kept to his way and have not turned aside. 
I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my allotted portion. 
But he is unchangeable, and who can change him? Whatever he has desired, he does. 
For he fulfills his decree against me, and many such things are his plans.
That is why I am terrified in his presence; when I consider, I am afraid because of him.
Indeed, God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.
Yet I have not been silent because of the darkness, because of the thick darkness that covered my face.
