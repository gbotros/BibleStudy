Then Bildad the Shuhite answered: 
“Dominion and awesome might belong to God; he establishes peace in his heights. 
Can his armies be numbered? On whom does his light not rise? 
How then can a human being be righteous before God? How can one born of a woman be pure? 
If even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not pure as far as he is concerned, 
how much less a mortal man, who is but a maggot— a son of man, who is only a worm!”
