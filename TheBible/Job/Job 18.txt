Then Bildad the Shuhite answered: 
“How long until you make an end of words? You must consider, and then we can talk. 
Why should we be regarded as beasts, and considered stupid in your sight? 
You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger, will the earth be abandoned for your sake? Or will a rock be moved from its place? 
“Yes, the lamp of the wicked is extinguished; his flame of fire does not shine. 
The light in his tent grows dark; his lamp above him is extinguished. 
His vigorous steps are restricted, and his own counsel throws him down. 
For he has been thrown into a net by his feet, and he wanders into a mesh. 
A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare grips him.
A rope is hidden for him on the ground, and a trap for him lies on the path. 
Terrors frighten him on all sides and dog his every step. 
Calamity is hungry for him, and misfortune is ready at his side. 
It eats away parts of his skin; the most terrible death devours his limbs. 
He is dragged from the security of his tent, and marched off to the king of terrors. 
Fire resides in his tent; over his residence burning sulfur is scattered. 
Below his roots dry up, and his branches wither above. 
His memory perishes from the earth he has no name in the land. 
He is driven from light into darkness and is banished from the world. 
He has neither children nor descendants among his people, no survivor in those places he once stayed. 
People of the west are appalled at his fate; people of the east are seized with horror, saying,
‘Surely such is the residence of an evil man; and this is the place of one who has not known God.’”
