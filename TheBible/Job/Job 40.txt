Then the Lord answered Job: 
“Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let the person who accuses God give him an answer!” 
Then Job answered the Lord:
“Indeed, I am completely unworthy—how could I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth to silence myself.
I have spoken once, but I cannot answer; twice, but I will say no more.” 
Then the Lord answered Job from the whirlwind: 
“Get ready for a difficult task like a man. I will question you, and you will inform me.
Would you indeed annul my justice? Would you declare me guilty so that you might be right? 
Do you have an arm as powerful as God’s, and can you thunder with a voice like his?
Adorn yourself, then, with majesty and excellency, and clothe yourself with glory and honor. 
Scatter abroad the abundance of your anger. Look at every proud man and bring him low. 
Look at every proud man and abase him; crush the wicked on the spot. 
Hide them in the dust together; imprison them in the grave.
Then I myself will acknowledge to you that your own right hand can save you.
“Look now at Behemoth, which I made as I made you; it eats grass like the ox. 
Look at its strength in its loins and its power in the muscles of its belly. 
It makes its tail stiff like a cedar; the sinews of its thighs are tightly wound.
Its bones are tubes of bronze, its limbs like bars of iron. 
It ranks first among the works of God; the One who made it has furnished it with a sword. 
For the hills bring it food, where all the wild animals play. 
Under the lotus trees it lies, in the secrecy of the reeds and the marsh. 
The lotus trees conceal it in their shadow; the poplars by the stream conceal it.
If the river rages, it is not disturbed; it is secure, though the Jordan should surge up to its mouth. 
Can anyone catch it by its eyes or pierce its nose with a snare?
