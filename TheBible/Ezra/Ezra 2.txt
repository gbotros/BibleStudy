They searched for their records in the genealogical materials, but did not find them. They were therefore excluded from the priesthood.

not counting their male and female servants, who numbered 7,337. They also had 200 male and female singers

As they were able, they gave to the treasury for this work 61,000 drachmas of gold, 5,000 minas of silver, and 100 priestly robes. 
The priests, the Levites, some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants lived in their towns, and all the rest of Israel lived in their towns.
