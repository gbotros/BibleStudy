Genealogical records were kept for all Israel; they are recorded in the Scroll of the Kings of Israel.The people of Judah were carried away to Babylon because of their unfaithfulness. 
The first to resettle on their property and in their cities were some Israelites, priests, Levites, and temple servants. 
Some from the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim and Manasseh settled in Jerusalem. 
The settlers included: Uthai son of Ammihud, son of Omri, son of Imri, son of Bani, who was a descendant of Perez son of Judah.

The gatekeepers were:Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brothers. Shallum was the leader; 
he serves to this day at the King’s Gate on the east. These were the gatekeepers from the camp of the descendants of Levi. 
Shallum son of Kore, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah, and his relatives from his family (the Korahites) were assigned to guard the entrance to the sanctuary. Their ancestors had guarded the entrance to the Lord’s dwelling place.

All those selected to be gatekeepers at the entrances numbered 212. Their names were recorded in the genealogical records of their settlements. David and Samuel the prophet had appointed them to their positions. 
They and their descendants were assigned to guard the gates of the Lord’s sanctuary (that is, the tabernacle). 
The gatekeepers were posted on all four sides—east, west, north, and south. 
Their relatives, who lived in their settlements, came from time to time and served with them for seven-day periods.
The four head gatekeepers, who were Levites, were assigned to guard the storerooms and treasuries in God’s sanctuary.
They would spend the night in their posts all around God’s sanctuary, for they were assigned to guard it and would open it with the key every morning. 
Some of them were in charge of the articles used by those who served; they counted them when they brought them in and when they brought them out. 
Some of them were in charge of the equipment and articles of the sanctuary, as well as the flour, wine, olive oil, incense, and spices. 
(But some of the priests mixed the spices.) 
Mattithiah, a Levite, the firstborn son of Shallum the Korahite, was in charge of baking the bread for offerings.
Some of the Kohathites, their relatives, were in charge of preparing the bread that is displayed each Sabbath. 
The musicians and Levite family leaders stayed in rooms at the sanctuary and were exempt from other duties, for day and night they had to carry out their assigned tasks. 
These were the family leaders of the Levites, as listed in their genealogical records. They lived in Jerusalem.
