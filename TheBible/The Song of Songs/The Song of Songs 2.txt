<b>The Beloved to Her Lover:</b> I am a meadow flower from Sharon, a lily from the valleys. 
<b>The Lover to His Beloved:</b> Like a lily among the thorns, so is my darling among the maidens. 
<b>The Beloved about Her Lover:</b> Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste. 
<b>The Beloved about Her Lover:</b> He brought me into the banquet hall, and he looked at me lovingly. 
Sustain me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love.
His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me.
<b>The Beloved to the Maidens:</b> I admonish you, O maidens of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and by the young does of the open fields: Do not awaken or arouse love until it pleases! 
<b>The Beloved about Her Lover:</b> Listen! My lover is approaching! Look! Here he comes, leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills! 
My lover is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look! There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the window, peering through the lattice. 
<b>The Lover to His Beloved:</b> My lover spoke to me, saying: “Arise, my darling; My beautiful one, come away with me!
Look! The winter has passed, the winter rains are over and gone. 
Blossoms have appeared in the land; the time for pruning and singing has come; the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. 
The fig tree has ripened its figs; the vines have blossomed and give off their fragrance. Arise, come away my darling; my beautiful one, come away with me!”
<b>The Lover to His Beloved:</b> O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the hiding places of the mountain crags, let me see your face; let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely. 
<b>The Beloved to Her Lover:</b> Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes, that ruin the vineyards— for our vineyard is in bloom. 
<b>The Beloved about Her Lover:</b> My lover is mine and I am his; he grazes among the lilies. 
<b>The Beloved to Her Lover:</b> Until the dawn arrives and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved— be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountain gorges.
