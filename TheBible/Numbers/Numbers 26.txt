To a larger group you will give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group you will give a smaller inheritance. To each one its inheritance must be given according to the number of people in it.
The land must be divided by lot; and they will inherit in accordance with the names of their ancestral tribes. 
Their inheritance must be apportioned by lot among the larger and smaller groups.”

For the Lord had said of them, “They will surely die in the wilderness.” And there was not left a single man of them, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
