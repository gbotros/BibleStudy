 The Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron:

Those numbered in his division are 45,650.
All those numbered of the camp of Reuben, according to their divisions, are 151,450. They will travel second. 
“Then the tent of meeting with the camp of the Levites will travel in the middle of the camps. They will travel in the same order as they camped, each in his own place under his standard.

These are the Israelites, numbered according to their families. All those numbered in the camps, by their divisions, are 603,550.
But the Levites were not numbered among the other Israelites, as the Lord commanded Moses. 
So the Israelites did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses; that is the way they camped under their standards, and that is the way they traveled, each with his clan and family.
