Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We have such a high priest, one who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, 
a minister in the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that the Lord, not man, set up. 
For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. So this one, too, had to have something to offer. 
Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law. 
The place where they serve is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary, just as Moses was warned by God as he was about to complete the tabernacle. For he says, “<b>See that you make everything according to the design</b> <b>shown to you on the mountain</b>.” 
But now Jesus has obtained a superior ministry, since the covenant that he mediates is also better and is enacted on better promises. 
For if that first covenant had been faultless, no one would have looked for a second one. 
But showing its fault, God says to them, “<b>Look, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will complete a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah</b>.
<b>It will not be like the covenant</b> <b>that I made with their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not continue in my covenant, and I had no regard for them, says the Lord</b>.
<b>For this is the covenant that I will establish with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord</b>. <b>I will put</b> <b>my laws in their minds,</b> <b>and I will inscribe them on their hearts</b>. <b>And I will be their God, and they will be my people</b>. 
<b>And there will be no need at all</b> <b>for each one to teach his countryman or each one to teach his brother saying</b>, ‘<b>Know the Lord</b>,’ <b>since they will all know me, from the least to the greatest</b>. 
<b>For I will be merciful toward their evil deeds, and their sins I will remember no longer</b>.” 
When he speaks of a new covenant, he makes the first obsolete. Now what is growing obsolete and aging is about to disappear.
