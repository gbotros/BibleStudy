Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, partners in a heavenly calling, take note of Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess, 
who is faithful to the one who appointed him, as Moses was also in God’s house. 
For he has come to deserve greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house deserves greater honor than the house itself! 
For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God. 
Now Moses was <b>faithful</b> <b>in all God’s</b> <b>house</b> as a servant, to testify to the things that would be spoken. 
But Christ is faithful as a son over God’s house. We are of his house, if in fact we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope we take pride in.
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, “<b>Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks!</b> 
<b>Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of testing in the wilderness</b>.
<b>There your fathers tested me and tried me</b>, <b>and they saw my works for forty years</b>.
<b>Therefore, I became provoked at that generation and said</b>, ‘<b>Their hearts are always wandering,</b> <b>and they have not known my ways</b>.’
<b>As I swore in my anger</b>, ‘<b>They will never enter my rest!</b>’” 
See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has an evil, unbelieving heart that forsakes the living God. 
But exhort one another each day, as long as it is called “Today,” that none of you may become hardened by sin’s deception. 
For we have become partners with Christ, if in fact we hold our initial confidence firm until the end. 
As it says, “<b>Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks!</b> <b>Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion</b>.” 
For which ones heard and rebelled? Was it not all who came out of Egypt under Moses’ leadership?
And against whom was God provoked for forty years? Was it not those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness? 
And to whom did he swear they would never enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient? 
So we see that they could not enter because of unbelief.
