(3:19) “For indeed the day is coming, burning like a furnace, and all the arrogant evildoers will be chaff. The coming day will burn them up,” says the Lord of Heaven’s Armies. “It will not leave them even a root or branch. 
But for you who respect my name, the sun of vindication will rise with healing wings, and you will skip about like calves released from the stall. 
You will trample on the wicked, for they will be like ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I am preparing,” says the Lord of Heaven’s Armies. 
“Remember the law of my servant Moses, to whom at Horeb I gave rules and regulations for all Israel to obey.
Look, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord arrives. 
He will encourage fathers and their children to return to me, so that I will not come and strike the earth with judgment.”
