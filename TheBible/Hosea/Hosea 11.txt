“When Israel was a young man, I loved him like a son, and I summoned my son out of Egypt. 
But the more I summoned them, the farther they departed from me. They sacrificed to the Baal idols and burned incense to images. 
Yet it was I who led Ephraim; I took them by the arm, but they did not acknowledge that I had healed them.
I drew them with leather cords, with straps of hide; I lifted the yoke from their neck and gently fed them.
They will return to Egypt! Assyria will rule over them because they refuse to repent! 
A sword will flash in their cities; it will destroy the bars of their city gates, and will devour them in their fortresses. 
My people are obsessed with turning away from me; they call to Baal, but he will never exalt them!
“How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I surrender you, O Israel? How can I treat you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboyim? I have had a change of heart. All my tender compassions are aroused. 
I cannot carry out my fierce anger! I cannot totally destroy Ephraim! Because I am God, and not man—the Holy One among you— I will not come in wrath!
“He will roar like a lion, and they will follow the Lord; when he roars, his children will come trembling from the west. 
They will return in fear and trembling like birds from Egypt, like doves from Assyria, and I will settle them in their homes,” declares the Lord. 
(12:1) Ephraim has surrounded me with lies; the house of Israel has surrounded me with deceit. But Judah still roams about with God; he remains faithful to the Holy One.
