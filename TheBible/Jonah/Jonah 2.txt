Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the stomach of the fish 
and said, “I called out to the Lord from my distress, and he answered me; from the belly of Sheol I cried out for help, and you heard my prayer. 
You threw me into the deep waters, into the middle of the sea; the ocean current engulfed me; all the mighty waves you sent swept over me.
I thought I had been banished from your sight and that I would never again see your holy temple. 
Water engulfed me up to my neck; the deep ocean surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head. 
I went down to the very bottoms of the mountains; the gates of the netherworld barred me in forever, but you brought me up from the Pit, O Lord, my God. 
When my life was ebbing away, I called out to the Lord. And my prayer came to you, to your holy temple. 
Those who worship worthless idols forfeit the mercy that could be theirs. 
But as for me, I promise to offer a sacrifice to you with a public declaration of praise; I will surely do what I have promised. Salvation belongs to the Lord!” 
Then the Lord commanded the fish and it vomited Jonah out onto dry land.
