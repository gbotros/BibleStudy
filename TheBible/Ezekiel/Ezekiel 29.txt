In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the Lord’s message came to me: 
“Son of man, turn toward Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt. 
Tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “‘Look, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster lying in the midst of its waterways, who has said, “My Nile is my own, I made it for myself.”
I will put hooks in your jaws and stick the fish of your waterways to your scales. I will haul you up from the midst of your waterways, and all the fish of your waterways will stick to your scales. 
I will leave you in the wilderness, you and all the fish of your waterways; you will fall in the open field and will not be gathered up or collected. I have given you as food to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the skies. 
Then all those living in Egypt will know that I am the Lord because they were a reed staff for the house of Israel; 
when they grasped you with their hand, you broke and tore their shoulders, and when they leaned on you, you splintered and caused their legs to be unsteady. 
“‘Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Look, I am about to bring a sword against you, and I will kill every person and every animal. 
The land of Egypt will become a desolate ruin. Then they will know that I am the Lord. “‘Because he said, “The Nile is mine and I made it,”
I am against you and your waterways. I will turn the land of Egypt into an utter desolate ruin from Migdol to Syene, as far as the border with Ethiopia. 
No human foot will pass through it, and no animal’s foot will pass through it; it will be uninhabited for 40 years. 
I will turn the land of Egypt into a desolation in the midst of desolate lands; for 40 years her cities will lie desolate in the midst of ruined cities. I will scatter Egypt among the nations and disperse them among foreign countries. 
“‘For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: At the end of 40 years I will gather Egypt from the peoples where they were scattered. 
I will restore the fortunes of Egypt and will bring them back to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin; there they will be an insignificant kingdom. 
It will be the most insignificant of the kingdoms; it will never again exalt itself over the nations. I will make them so small that they will not rule over the nations. 
It will never again be Israel’s source of confidence, but a reminder of how they sinned by turning to Egypt for help. Then they will know that I am the Sovereign Lord.’” 
In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the Lord’s message came to me: 
“Son of man, King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre. Every head was rubbed bald and every shoulder rubbed bare; yet he and his army received no wages from Tyre for the work he carried out against it.
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Look, I am about to give the land of Egypt to King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon. He will carry off her wealth, capture her loot, and seize her plunder; it will be his army’s wages. 
I have given him the land of Egypt as his compensation for attacking Tyre, because they did it for me, declares the Sovereign Lord. 
On that day I will make Israel powerful, and I will give you the right to be heard among them. Then they will know that I am the Lord.”
