But as for you, communicate the behavior that goes with sound teaching. 
Older men are to be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in endurance. 
Older women likewise are to exhibit behavior fitting for those who are holy, not slandering, not slaves to excessive drinking, but teaching what is good. 
In this way they will train the younger women to love their husbands, to love their children, 
to be self-controlled, pure, fulfilling their duties at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the message of God may not be discredited. 
Encourage younger men likewise to be self-controlled, 
showing yourself to be an example of good works in every way. In your teaching show integrity, dignity, 
and a sound message that cannot be criticized, so that any opponent will be at a loss because he has nothing evil to say about us. 
Slaves are to be subject to their own masters in everything, to do what is wanted and not talk back, 
not pilfering, but showing all good faith, in order to bring credit to the teaching of God our Savior in everything. 
For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people. 
It trains us to reject godless ways and worldly desires and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, 
as we wait for the happy fulfillment of our hope in the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. 
He gave himself for us to set us free from every kind of lawlessness and to purify for himself a people who are truly his, who are eager to do good. 
So communicate these things with the sort of exhortation or rebuke that carries full authority. Donâ€™t let anyone look down on you.
