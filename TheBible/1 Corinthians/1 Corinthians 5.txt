It is actually reported that sexual immorality exists among you, the kind of immorality that is not permitted even among the Gentiles, so that someone is cohabiting with his father’s wife. 
And you are proud! Shouldn’t you have been deeply sorrowful instead and removed the one who did this from among you? 
For even though I am absent physically, I am present in spirit. And I have already judged the one who did this, just as though I were present. 
When you gather together in the name of our Lord Jesus, and I am with you in spirit, along with the power of our Lord Jesus, 
hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord. 
Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast affects the whole batch of dough? 
Clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch of dough—you are, in fact, without yeast. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. 
So then, let us celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of vice and evil, but with the bread without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth. 
I wrote you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people. 
In no way did I mean the immoral people of this world, or the greedy and swindlers and idolaters, since you would then have to go out of the world. 
But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who calls himself a Christian who is sexually immoral, or greedy, or an idolater, or verbally abusive, or a drunkard, or a swindler. Do not even eat with such a person. 
For what do I have to do with judging those outside? Are you not to judge those inside? 
But God will judge those outside. Remove the evil person from among you.
