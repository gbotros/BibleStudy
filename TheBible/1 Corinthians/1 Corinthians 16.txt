With regard to the collection for the saints, please follow the directions that I gave to the churches of Galatia: 
On the first day of the week, each of you should set aside some income and save it to the extent that God has blessed you, so that a collection will not have to be made when I come. 
Then, when I arrive, I will send those whom you approve with letters of explanation to carry your gift to Jerusalem. 
And if it seems advisable that I should go also, they will go with me. 
But I will come to you after I have gone through Macedonia—for I will be going through Macedonia—
and perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you can send me on my journey, wherever I go. 
For I do not want to see you now in passing, since I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord allows. 
But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, 
because a door of great opportunity stands wide open for me, but there are many opponents. 
Now if Timothy comes, see that he has nothing to fear among you, for he is doing the Lord’s work, as I am too.
So then, let no one treat him with contempt. But send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me. For I am expecting him with the brothers. 
With regard to our brother Apollos: I strongly encouraged him to visit you with the other brothers, but it was simply not his intention to come now. He will come when he has the opportunity. 
Stay alert, stand firm in the faith, show courage, be strong. 
Everything you do should be done in love. 
Now, brothers and sisters, you know about the household of Stephanus, that as the first converts of Achaia, they devoted themselves to ministry for the saints. I urge you 
also to submit to people like this, and to everyone who cooperates in the work and labors hard. 
I was glad about the arrival of Stephanus, Fortunatus, and Achaicus because they have supplied the fellowship with you that I lacked. 
For they refreshed my spirit and yours. So then, recognize people like this. 
The churches in the province of Asia send greetings to you. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord, with the church that meets in their house. 
All the brothers and sisters send greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss. 
I, Paul, send this greeting with my own hand. 
Let anyone who has no love for the Lord be accursed. Our Lord, come! 
The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. 
My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus.
