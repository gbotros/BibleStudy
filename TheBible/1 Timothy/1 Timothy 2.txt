First of all, then, I urge that requests, prayers, intercessions, and thanks be offered on behalf of all people, 
even for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. 
Such prayer for all is good and welcomed before God our Savior, 
since he wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. 
For there is one God and one intermediary between God and humanity, Christ Jesus, himself human, 
who gave himself as a ransom for all, revealing God’s purpose at his appointed time. 
For this I was appointed a preacher and apostle—I am telling the truth; I am not lying—and a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. 
So I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or dispute. 
Likewise the women are to dress in suitable apparel, with modesty and self-control. Their adornment must not be with braided hair and gold or pearls or expensive clothing, 
but with good deeds, as is proper for women who profess reverence for God. 
A woman must learn quietly with all submissiveness. 
But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man. She must remain quiet. 
For Adam was formed first and then Eve. 
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, because she was fully deceived, fell into transgression. 
But she will be delivered through childbearing, if she continues in faith and love and holiness with self-control.
