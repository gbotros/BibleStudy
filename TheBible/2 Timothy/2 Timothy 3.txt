But understand this, that in the last days difficult times will come. 
For people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, 
unloving, irreconcilable, slanderers, without self-control, savage, opposed to what is good, 
treacherous, reckless, conceited, loving pleasure rather than loving God. 
They will maintain the outward appearance of religion but will have repudiated its power. So avoid people like these. 
For some of these insinuate themselves into households and captivate weak women who are overwhelmed with sins and led along by various passions. 
Such women are always seeking instruction, yet never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth. 
And just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these people—who have warped minds and are disqualified in the faith—also oppose the truth. 
But they will not go much further, for their foolishness will be obvious to everyone, just like it was with Jannes and Jambres. 
You, however, have followed my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance, 
as well as the persecutions and sufferings that happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, and in Lystra. I endured these persecutions, and the Lord delivered me from them all. 
Now in fact all who want to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. 
But evil people and charlatans will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and being deceived themselves.
You, however, must continue in the things you have learned and are confident about. You know who taught you
and how from infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to give you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 
Every scripture is inspired by God and useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, 
that the person dedicated to God may be capable and equipped for every good work.
