At that time you will say: “I praise you, O Lord, for even though you were angry with me, your anger subsided, and you consoled me.
Look, God is my deliverer! I will trust in him and not fear. For the Lord gives me strength and protects me; he has become my deliverer.” 
Joyfully you will draw water from the springs of deliverance. 
At that time you will say: “Praise the Lord! Ask him for help! Publicize his mighty acts among the nations. Make it known that he is unique. 
Sing to the Lord, for he has done magnificent things; let this be known throughout the earth. 
Cry out and shout for joy, O citizens of Zion, for the Holy One of Israel acts mightily among you!”
