A song of ascents; by David. “If the Lord had not been on our side”— let Israel say this.—
if the Lord had not been on our side, when men attacked us, 
they would have swallowed us alive, when their anger raged against us.
The water would have overpowered us; the current would have overwhelmed us. 
The raging water would have overwhelmed us. 
The Lord deserves praise, for he did not hand us over as prey to their teeth. 
We escaped with our lives, like a bird from a hunter’s snare. The snare broke, and we escaped. 
Our deliverer is the Lord, the Creator of heaven and earth.
