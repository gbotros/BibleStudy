For the music director, according to the gittith style; by Asaph. Shout for joy to God, our source of strength! Shout out to the God of Jacob! 
Sing a song and play the tambourine, the pleasant-sounding harp, and the ten-stringed instrument. 
Sound the ram’s horn on the day of the new moon and on the day of the full moon when our festival begins.
For observing the festival is a requirement for Israel; it is an ordinance given by the God of Jacob. 
He decreed it as a regulation in Joseph, when he attacked the land of Egypt. I heard a voice I did not recognize. 
It said: “I removed the burden from his shoulder; his hands were released from holding the basket. 
In your distress you called out and I rescued you. I answered you from a dark thundercloud. I tested you at the waters of Meribah. (Selah)
I said, ‘Listen, my people! I will warn you. O Israel, if only you would obey me!
There must be no other god among you. You must not worship a foreign god. 
I am the Lord, your God, the one who brought you out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.’
But my people did not obey me; Israel did not submit to me. 
I gave them over to their stubborn desires; they did what seemed right to them.
If only my people would obey me! If only Israel would keep my commands! 
Then I would quickly subdue their enemies, and attack their adversaries.” 
(May those who hate the Lord cower in fear before him. May they be permanently humiliated.) 
“I would feed Israel the best wheat, and would satisfy your appetite with honey from the rocky cliffs.”
