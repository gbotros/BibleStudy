For the music director, a psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; the sky displays his handiwork.
Day after day it speaks out; night after night it reveals his greatness. 
There is no actual speech or word, nor is its voice literally heard. 
Yet its voice echoes throughout the earth; its words carry to the distant horizon. In the sky he has pitched a tent for the sun. 
Like a bridegroom it emerges from its chamber; like a strong man it enjoys running its course. 
It emerges from the distant horizon, and goes from one end of the sky to the other; nothing can escape its heat. 
The law of the Lord is perfect and preserves one’s life. The rules set down by the Lord are reliable and impart wisdom to the inexperienced. 
The Lord’s precepts are fair and make one joyful. The Lord’s commands are pure and give insight for life. 
The commands to fear the Lord are right and endure forever. The judgments given by the Lord are trustworthy and absolutely just. 
They are of greater value than gold, than even a great amount of pure gold; they bring greater delight than honey, than even the sweetest honey from a honeycomb. 
Yes, your servant finds moral guidance there; those who obey them receive a rich reward. 
Who can know all his errors? Please do not punish me for sins I am unaware of. 
Moreover, keep me from committing flagrant sins; do not allow such sins to control me. Then I will be blameless and innocent of blatant rebellion. 
May my words and my thoughts be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, my sheltering rock and my redeemer.
