For the music director, a psalm of David. O Lord, rescue me from wicked men. Protect me from violent men, 
who plan ways to harm me. All day long they stir up conflict.
Their tongues wound like a serpent; a viper’s venom is behind their lips. (Selah)
O Lord, shelter me from the power of the wicked. Protect me from violent men, who plan to knock me over.
Proud men hide a snare for me; evil men spread a net by the path. They set traps for me. (Selah)
I say to the Lord, “You are my God.” O Lord, pay attention to my plea for mercy.
O Sovereign Lord, my strong deliverer, you shield my head in the day of battle. 
O Lord, do not let the wicked have their way. Do not allow their plan to succeed when they attack. (Selah)
As for the heads of those who surround me— may the harm done by their lips overwhelm them.
May he rain down fiery coals upon them. May he throw them into the fire. From bottomless pits they will not escape. 
A slanderer will not endure on the earth; calamity will hunt down a violent man and strike him down. 
I know that the Lord defends the cause of the oppressed and vindicates the poor. 
Certainly the godly will give thanks to your name; the morally upright will live in your presence.
