For the music director, according to the al-tashcheth style; a prayer of David, written when he fled from Saul into the cave. Have mercy on me, O God. Have mercy on me. For in you I have taken shelter. In the shadow of your wings I take shelter until trouble passes. 
I cry out for help to God Most High, to the God who vindicates me.
May he send help from heaven and deliver me from my enemies who hurl insults. (Selah) May God send his loyal love and faithfulness. 
I am surrounded by lions; I lie down among those who want to devour me, men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords. 
Rise up above the sky, O God. May your splendor cover the whole earth. 
They have prepared a net to trap me; I am discouraged. They have dug a pit for me. They will fall into it. (Selah)
I am determined, O God. I am determined. I will sing and praise you.
Awake, my soul! Awake, O stringed instrument and harp! I will wake up at dawn. 
I will give you thanks before the nations, O Lord. I will sing praises to you before foreigners. 
For your loyal love extends beyond the sky, and your faithfulness reaches the clouds. 
Rise up above the sky, O God. May your splendor cover the whole earth.
