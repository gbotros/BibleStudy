For the music director, by David. In the Lord I have taken shelter. How can you say to me, “Flee to a mountain like a bird. 
For look, the wicked prepare their bows, they put their arrows on the strings, to shoot in the darkness at the morally upright. 
When the foundations are destroyed, what can the godly accomplish?” 
The Lord is in his holy temple; the Lord’s throne is in heaven. His eyes watch; his eyes examine all people. 
The Lord approves of the godly, but he hates the wicked and those who love to do violence. 
May he rain down burning coals and brimstone on the wicked! A whirlwind is what they deserve.
Certainly the Lord is just; he rewards godly deeds. The upright will experience his favor.
