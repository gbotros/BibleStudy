By David. The Lord is my light and my salvation. I fear no one. The Lord protects my life. I am afraid of no one. 
When evil men attack me to devour my flesh, when my adversaries and enemies attack me, they stumble and fall. 
Even when an army is deployed against me, I do not fear. Even when war is imminent, I remain confident. 
I have asked the Lord for one thing— this is what I desire! I want to live in the Lord’s house all the days of my life, so I can gaze at the splendor of the Lord and contemplate in his temple. 
He will surely give me shelter in the day of danger; he will hide me in his home. He will place me on an inaccessible rocky summit.
Now I will triumph over my enemies who surround me. I will offer sacrifices in his dwelling place and shout for joy. I will sing praises to the Lord. 
Hear me, O Lord, when I cry out. Have mercy on me and answer me.
My heart tells me to pray to you, and I do pray to you, O Lord. 
Do not reject me. Do not push your servant away in anger. You are my deliverer. Do not forsake or abandon me, O God who vindicates me.
Even if my father and mother abandoned me, the Lord would take me in.
Teach me how you want me to live, Lord; lead me along a level path because of those who wait to ambush me.
Do not turn me over to my enemies, for false witnesses who want to destroy me testify against me. 
Where would I be if I did not believe I would experience the Lord’s favor in the land of the living? 
Rely on the Lord! Be strong and confident! Rely on the Lord!
