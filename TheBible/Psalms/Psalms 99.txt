The Lord reigns! The nations tremble. He sits enthroned above the cherubim; the earth shakes.
The Lord is elevated in Zion; he is exalted over all the nations. 
Let them praise your great and awesome name. He is holy! 
The king is strong; he loves justice. You ensure that legal decisions will be made fairly; you promote justice and equity in Jacob. 
Praise the Lord our God. Worship before his footstool. He is holy! 
Moses and Aaron were among his priests; Samuel was one of those who prayed to him. They prayed to the Lord and he answered them.
He spoke to them from a pillar of cloud; they obeyed his regulations and the ordinance he gave them. 
O Lord our God, you answered them. They found you to be a forgiving God, but also one who punished their sinful deeds. 
Praise the Lord our God! Worship on his holy hill, for the Lord our God is holy.
