A song of ascents. How blessed is every one of the Lordâ€™s loyal followers, each one who keeps his commands. 
You will eat what you worked so hard to grow. You will be blessed and secure. 
Your wife will be like a fruitful vine in the inner rooms of your house; your children will be like olive branches, as they sit all around your table. 
Yes indeed, the man who fears the Lord will be blessed in this way. 
May the Lord bless you from Zion that you might see Jerusalem prosper all the days of your life 
and that you might see your grandchildren. May Israel experience peace.
