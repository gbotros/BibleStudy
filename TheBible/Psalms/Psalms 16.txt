A prayer of David. Protect me, O God, for I have taken shelter in you.
I say to the Lord, “You are the Lord, my only source of well-being.” 
As for God’s chosen people who are in the land, and the leading officials I admired so much—
their troubles multiply; they desire other gods. I will not pour out drink offerings of blood to their gods, nor will I make vows in the name of their gods. 
Lord, you give me stability and prosperity; you make my future secure. 
It is as if I have been given fertile fields or received a beautiful tract of land. 
I will praise the Lord who guides me; yes, during the night I reflect and learn. 
I constantly trust in the Lord; because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. 
So my heart rejoices and I am happy; my life is safe. 
You will not abandon me to Sheol; you will not allow your faithful follower to see the Pit. 
You lead me in the path of life. I experience absolute joy in your presence; you always give me sheer delight.
