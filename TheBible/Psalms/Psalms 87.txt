Written by the Korahites; a psalm, a song. The Lord’s city is in the holy hills. 
The Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob. 
People say wonderful things about you, O city of God. (Selah)
I mention Rahab and Babylon to my followers. Here are Philistia and Tyre, along with Ethiopia. It is said of them, “This one was born there.” 
But it is said of Zion’s residents, “Each one of these was born in her, and the Most High makes her secure.” 
The Lord writes in the census book of the nations, “This one was born there.” (Selah)
As for the singers, as well as the pipers— all of them sing within your walls.
