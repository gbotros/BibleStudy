A psalm. Sing to the Lord a new song, for he performs amazing deeds. His right hand and his mighty arm accomplish deliverance. 
The Lord demonstrates his power to deliver; in the sight of the nations he reveals his justice. 
He remains loyal and faithful to the family of Israel. All the ends of the earth see our God deliver us.
Shout out praises to the Lord, all the earth. Break out in a joyful shout and sing! 
Sing to the Lord accompanied by a harp, accompanied by a harp and the sound of music. 
With trumpets and the blaring of the ramâ€™s horn, shout out praises before the king, the Lord. 
Let the sea and everything in it shout, along with the world and those who live in it.
Let the rivers clap their hands! Let the mountains sing in unison 
before the Lord. For he comes to judge the earth. He judges the world fairly, and the nations in a just manner.
