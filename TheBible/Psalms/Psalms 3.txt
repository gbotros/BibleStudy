A psalm of David, written when he fled from his son Absalom. Lord, how numerous are my enemies! Many attack me.
Many say about me, “God will not deliver him.” (Selah)
But you, Lord, are a shield that protects me; you are my glory and the one who restores me. 
To the Lord I cried out, and he answered me from his holy hill. (Selah)
I rested and slept; I awoke, for the Lord protects me.
I am not afraid of the multitude of people who attack me from all directions.
Rise up, Lord! Deliver me, my God! Yes, you will strike all my enemies on the jaw; you will break the teeth of the wicked. 
The Lord delivers; you show favor to your people. (Selah)
