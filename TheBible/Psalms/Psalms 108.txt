A song, a psalm of David. I am determined, O God. I will sing and praise you with my whole heart. 
Awake, O stringed instrument and harp. I will wake up at dawn. 
I will give you thanks before the nations, O Lord. I will sing praises to you before foreigners. 
For your loyal love extends beyond the sky, and your faithfulness reaches the clouds. 
Rise up above the sky, O God. May your splendor cover the whole earth. 
Deliver by your power and answer me, so that the ones you love may be safe. 
God has spoken in his sanctuary: “I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem; the Valley of Sukkoth I will measure off.
Gilead belongs to me, as does Manasseh. Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my royal scepter. 
Moab is my washbasin. I will make Edom serve me. I will shout in triumph over Philistia.” 
Who will lead me into the fortified city? Who will bring me to Edom? 
Have you not rejected us, O God? O God, you do not go into battle with our armies. 
Give us help against the enemy, for any help men might offer is futile. 
By God’s power we will conquer; he will trample down our enemies.
