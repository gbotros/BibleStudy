By David. To you, O Lord, I cry out! My Protector, do not ignore me. If you do not respond to me, I will join those who are descending into the grave. 
Hear my plea for mercy when I cry out to you for help, when I lift my hands toward your holy temple. 
Do not drag me away with evil men, with those who behave wickedly, who talk so friendly to their neighbors, while they plan to harm them.
Pay them back for their evil deeds. Pay them back for what they do. Punish them. 
For they do not understand the Lordâ€™s actions, or the way he carries out justice. The Lord will permanently demolish them.
The Lord deserves praise, for he has heard my plea for mercy.
The Lord strengthens and protects me; I trust in him with all my heart. I am rescued and my heart is full of joy; I will sing to him in gratitude. 
The Lord strengthens his people; he protects and delivers his chosen king. 
Deliver your people. Empower the nation that belongs to you. Care for them like a shepherd and carry them in your arms at all times!
