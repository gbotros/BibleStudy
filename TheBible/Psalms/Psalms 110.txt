A psalm of David. Here is the Lord’s proclamation to my lord: “Sit down at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.” 
The Lord extends your dominion from Zion. Rule in the midst of your enemies. 
Your people willingly follow you when you go into battle. On the holy hills at sunrise the dew of your youth belongs to you.
The Lord makes this promise on oath and will not revoke it: “You are an eternal priest after the pattern of Melchizedek.” 
O Lord, at your right hand he strikes down kings in the day he unleashes his anger. 
He executes judgment against the nations. He fills the valleys with corpses; he shatters their heads over the vast battlefield. 
From the stream along the road he drinks; then he lifts up his head.
