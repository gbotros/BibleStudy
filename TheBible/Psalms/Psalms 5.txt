For the music director, to be accompanied by wind instruments; a psalm of David. Listen to what I say, Lord! Carefully consider my complaint! 
Pay attention to my cry for help, my King and my God, for I am praying to you!
Lord, in the morning you will hear me; in the morning I will present my case to you and then wait expectantly for an answer.
Certainly you are not a God who approves of evil; evil people cannot dwell with you. 
Arrogant people cannot stand in your presence; you hate all who behave wickedly. 
You destroy liars; the Lord despises violent and deceitful people. 
But as for me, because of your great faithfulness I will enter your house; I will bow down toward your holy temple as I worship you. 
Lord, lead me in your righteousness because of those who wait to ambush me, remove the obstacles in the way in which you are guiding me.
For they do not speak the truth; their stomachs are like the place of destruction, their throats like an open grave, their tongues like a steep slope leading into it.
Condemn them, O God! May their own schemes be their downfall. Drive them away because of their many acts of insurrection, for they have rebelled against you.
But may all who take shelter in you be happy. May they continually shout for joy. Shelter them so that those who are loyal to you may rejoice. 
Certainly you reward the godly, Lord. Like a shield you protect them in your good favor.
