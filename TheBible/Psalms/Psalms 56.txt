For the music director, according to the yonath-elem-rekhoqim style; a prayer of David, written when the Philistines captured him in Gath. Have mercy on me, O God, for men are attacking me. All day long hostile enemies are tormenting me.
Those who anticipate my defeat attack me all day long. Indeed, many are fighting against me, O Exalted One.
When I am afraid, I trust in you.
In God—I boast in his promise— in God I trust; I am not afraid. What can mere men do to me?
All day long they cause me trouble; they make a habit of plotting my demise. 
They stalk and lurk; they watch my every step, as they prepare to take my life. 
Because they are bent on violence, do not let them escape. In your anger bring down the nations, O God. 
You keep track of my misery. Put my tears in your leather container. Are they not recorded in your scroll? 
My enemies will turn back when I cry out to you for help; I know that God is on my side.
In God—I boast in his promise— in the Lord—I boast in his promise—
in God I trust; I am not afraid. What can mere men do to me?
I am obligated to fulfill the vows I made to you, O God; I will give you the thank offerings you deserve,
when you deliver my life from death. You keep my feet from stumbling, so that I might serve God as I enjoy life.
