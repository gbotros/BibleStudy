A psalm of David. O Lord, I cry out to you. Come quickly to me. Pay attention to me when I cry out to you.
May you accept my prayer like incense, my uplifted hands like the evening offering. 
O Lord, place a guard on my mouth. Protect the opening of my lips. 
Do not let me have evil desires or participate in sinful activities with men who behave wickedly. I will not eat their delicacies. 
May the godly strike me in love and correct me. May my head not refuse choice oil. Indeed, my prayer is a witness against their evil deeds.
They will be thrown over the side of a cliff by their judges. They will listen to my words, for they are pleasant. 
As when one plows and breaks up the soil, so our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol. 
Surely I am looking to you, O Sovereign Lord. In you I take shelter. Do not expose me to danger. 
Protect me from the snare they have laid for me and the traps the evildoers have set. 
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I escape.
