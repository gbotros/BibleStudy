Acknowledge that the Lord is God. He made us and we belong to him, we are his people, the sheep of his pasture. 
Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise. Give him thanks. Praise his name. 
For the Lord is good. His loyal love endures, and he is faithful through all generations.
