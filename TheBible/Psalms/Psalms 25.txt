By David. O Lord, I come before you in prayer. 
My God, I trust in you. Please do not let me be humiliated; do not let my enemies triumphantly rejoice over me.
Certainly none who rely on you will be humiliated. Those who deal in treachery will be thwarted and humiliated. 
Make me understand your ways, O Lord. Teach me your paths. 
Guide me into your truth and teach me. For you are the God who delivers me; on you I rely all day long.
Remember your compassionate and faithful deeds, O Lord, for you have always acted in this manner. 
Do not hold against me the sins of my youth or my rebellious acts. Because you are faithful to me, extend to me your favor, O Lord. 
The Lord is both kind and fair; that is why he teaches sinners the right way to live.
May he show the humble what is right. May he teach the humble his way. 
The Lord always proves faithful and reliable to those who follow the demands of his covenant. 
For the sake of your reputation, O Lord, forgive my sin, because it is great. 
The Lord shows his faithful followers the way they should live. 
They experience his favor; their descendants inherit the land. 
The Lord’s loyal followers receive his guidance, and he reveals his covenantal demands to them.
I continually look to the Lord for help, for he will free my feet from the enemy’s net. 
Turn toward me and have mercy on me, for I am alone and oppressed. 
Deliver me from my distress; rescue me from my suffering. 
See my pain and suffering. Forgive all my sins. 
Watch my enemies, for they outnumber me; they hate me and want to harm me. 
Protect me and deliver me! Please do not let me be humiliated, for I have taken shelter in you.
May integrity and godliness protect me, for I rely on you.
O God, rescue Israel from all their distress!
