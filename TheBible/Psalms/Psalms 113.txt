Praise the Lord. Praise, you servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord. 
May the Lord’s name be praised now and forevermore. 
From east to west the Lord’s name is deserving of praise. 
The Lord is exalted over all the nations; his splendor reaches beyond the sky. 
Who can compare to the Lord our God, who sits on a high throne? 
He bends down to look at the sky and the earth. 
He raises the poor from the dirt and lifts up the needy from the garbage pile
that he might seat him with princes, with the princes of his people. 
He makes the barren woman of the family a happy mother of children. Praise the Lord.
