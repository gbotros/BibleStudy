For the music director, according to the shushan-eduth style; a psalm of Asaph. O Shepherd of Israel, pay attention, you who lead Joseph like a flock of sheep. You who sit enthroned above the cherubim, reveal your splendor. 
In the sight of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh reveal your power. Come and deliver us.
O God, restore us. Smile on us. Then we will be delivered. 
O Lord God of Heaven’s Armies, how long will you remain angry at your people while they pray to you?
You have given them tears as food; you have made them drink tears by the measure. 
You have made our neighbors dislike us and our enemies insult us.
O God of Heaven’s Armies, restore us. Smile on us. Then we will be delivered. 
You uprooted a vine from Egypt; you drove out nations and transplanted it.
You cleared the ground for it; it took root and filled the land. 
The mountains were covered by its shadow, the highest cedars by its branches. 
Its branches reached the Mediterranean Sea, and its shoots the Euphrates River.
Why did you break down its walls, so that all who pass by pluck its fruit?
The wild boars of the forest ruin it; the insects of the field feed on it.
O God of Heaven’s Armies, come back. Look down from heaven and take notice. Take care of this vine, 
the root your right hand planted, the shoot you made to grow. 
It is burned and cut down. May those who did this die because you are displeased with them.
May you give support to the one you have chosen, to the one whom you raised up for yourself.
Then we will not turn away from you. Revive us and we will pray to you. 
O Lord God of Heaven’s Armies, restore us. Smile on us. Then we will be delivered.
