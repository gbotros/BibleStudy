A psalm; a song for the Sabbath day. It is fitting to thank the Lord, and to sing praises to your name, O Most High.
It is fitting to proclaim your loyal love in the morning and your faithfulness during the night, 
to the accompaniment of a ten-stringed instrument and a lyre, to the accompaniment of the meditative tone of the harp. 
For you, O Lord, have made me happy by your work. I will sing for joy because of what you have done. 
How great are your works, O Lord! Your plans are very intricate! 
The spiritually insensitive do not recognize this; the fool does not understand this. 
When the wicked sprout up like grass, and all the evildoers glisten, it is so that they may be annihilated.
But you, O Lord, reign forever. 
Indeed, look at your enemies, O Lord. Indeed, look at how your enemies perish. All the evildoers are scattered. 
You exalt my horn like that of a wild ox. I am covered with fresh oil. 
I gloat in triumph over those who tried to ambush me; I hear the defeated cries of the evil foes who attacked me. 
The godly grow like a palm tree; they grow high like a cedar in Lebanon. 
Planted in the Lord’s house, they grow in the courts of our God. 
They bear fruit even when they are old; they are filled with vitality and have many leaves. 
So they proclaim that the Lord, my Protector, is just and never unfair.
