A song of ascents. In my distress I cried out to the Lord and he answered me.
I said, “O Lord, rescue me from those who lie with their lips and those who deceive with their tongues.” 
How will he severely punish you, you deceptive talker? 
Here’s how! With the sharp arrows of warriors, with arrowheads forged over the hot coals. 
How miserable I am. For I have lived temporarily in Meshech; I have resided among the tents of Kedar. 
For too long I have had to reside with those who hate peace. 
I am committed to peace, but when I speak, they want to make war.
