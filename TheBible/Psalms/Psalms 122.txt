A song of ascents; by David. I was glad because they said to me, “We will go to the Lord’s temple.” 
Our feet are standing inside your gates, O Jerusalem. 
Jerusalem is a city designed to accommodate an assembly.
The tribes go up there, the tribes of the Lord, where it is required that Israel give thanks to the name of the Lord. 
Indeed, the leaders sit there on thrones and make legal decisions, on the thrones of the house of David. 
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. May those who love her prosper. 
May there be peace inside your defenses and prosperity inside your fortresses. 
For the sake of my brothers and my neighbors I will say, “May there be peace in you.”
For the sake of the temple of the Lord our God I will pray for you to prosper.
