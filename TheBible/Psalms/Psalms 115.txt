Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to your name bring honor, for the sake of your loyal love and faithfulness. 
Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” 
Our God is in heaven. He does whatever he pleases. 
Their idols are made of silver and gold— they are man-made.
They have mouths, but cannot speak; eyes, but cannot see; 
ears, but cannot hear; noses, but cannot smell; 
hands, but cannot touch; feet, but cannot walk. They cannot even clear their throats. 
Those who make them will end up like them, as will everyone who trusts in them.
O Israel, trust in the Lord. He is their deliverer and protector. 
O family of Aaron, trust in the Lord. He is their deliverer and protector. 
You loyal followers of the Lord, trust in the Lord. He is their deliverer and protector. 
The Lord takes notice of us; he will bless— he will bless the family of Israel, he will bless the family of Aaron. 
He will bless his loyal followers, both young and old. 
May he increase your numbers, yours and your children’s.
May you be blessed by the Lord, the Creator of heaven and earth. 
The heavens belong to the Lord, but the earth he has given to mankind. 
The dead do not praise the Lord, nor do any of those who descend into the silence of death.
But we will praise the Lord now and forevermore. Praise the Lord!
