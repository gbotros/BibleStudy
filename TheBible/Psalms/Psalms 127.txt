A song of ascents; by Solomon. If the Lord does not build a house, then those who build it work in vain. If the Lord does not guard a city, then the watchman stands guard in vain. 
It is vain for you to rise early, come home late, and work so hard for your food. Yes, he provides for those whom he loves even when they sleep. 
Yes, sons are a gift from the Lord; the fruit of the womb is a reward. 
Sons born during one’s youth are like arrows in a warrior’s hand. 
How blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them. They will not be put to shame when they confront enemies at the city gate.
