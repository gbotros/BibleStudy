For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a psalm of Asaph, a song. God has revealed himself in Judah; in Israel his reputation is great. 
He lives in Salem; he dwells in Zion. 
There he shattered the arrows, the shield, the sword, and the rest of the weapons of war. (Selah)
You shine brightly and reveal your majesty, as you descend from the hills where you killed your prey. 
The bravehearted were plundered; they “fell asleep.” All the warriors were helpless.
At the sound of your battle cry, O God of Jacob, both rider and horse “fell asleep.” 
You are awesome! Yes, you! Who can withstand your intense anger? 
From heaven you announced what their punishment would be. The earth was afraid and silent 
when God arose to execute judgment, and to deliver all the oppressed of the earth. (Selah)
Certainly your angry judgment upon men will bring you praise; you reveal your anger in full measure. 
Make vows to the Lord your God and repay them. Let all those who surround him bring tribute to the awesome one.
He humbles princes; the kings of the earth regard him as awesome.
