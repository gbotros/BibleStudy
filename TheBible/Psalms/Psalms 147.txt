Praise the Lord, for it is good to sing praises to our God. Yes, praise is pleasant and appropriate. 
The Lord rebuilds Jerusalem and gathers the exiles of Israel. 
He heals the brokenhearted and bandages their wounds. 
He counts the number of the stars; he names all of them.
Our Lord is great and has awesome power; there is no limit to his wisdom. 
The Lord lifts up the oppressed, but knocks the wicked to the ground. 
Offer to the Lord a song of thanks. Sing praises to our God to the accompaniment of a harp. 
He covers the sky with clouds, provides the earth with rain, and causes grass to grow on the hillsides. 
He gives food to the animals and to the young ravens when they chirp. 
He is not enamored with the strength of a horse, nor is he impressed by the warriorâ€™s strong legs. 
The Lord takes delight in his faithful followers and in those who wait for his loyal love. 
Extol the Lord, O Jerusalem. Praise your God, O Zion. 
For he makes the bars of your gates strong. He blesses your children within you.
He brings peace to your territory. He abundantly provides for you the best grain. 
He sends his command through the earth; swiftly his order reaches its destination. 
He sends the snow that is white like wool; he spreads the frost that is white like ashes. 
He throws his hailstones like crumbs. Who can withstand the cold wind he sends?
He then orders it all to melt; he breathes on it, and the water flows. 
He proclaims his word to Jacob, his statutes and regulations to Israel. 
He has not done so with any other nation; they are not aware of his regulations. Praise the Lord!
