A psalm of David. Acknowledge the Lord, you heavenly beings, acknowledge the Lord’s majesty and power. 
Acknowledge the majesty of the Lord’s reputation. Worship the Lord in holy attire. 
The Lord’s shout is heard over the water; the majestic God thunders, the Lord appears over the surging water. 
The Lord’s shout is powerful; the Lord’s shout is majestic. 
The Lord’s shout breaks the cedars; the Lord shatters the cedars of Lebanon. 
He makes them skip like a calf, Lebanon and Sirion like a young ox. 
The Lord’s shout strikes with flaming fire. 
The Lord’s shout shakes the wilderness; the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh. 
The Lord’s shout bends the large trees and strips the leaves from the forests. Everyone in his temple says, “Majestic!”
The Lord sits enthroned over the engulfing waters; the Lord sits enthroned as the eternal king. 
The Lord gives his people strength; the Lord grants his people security.
