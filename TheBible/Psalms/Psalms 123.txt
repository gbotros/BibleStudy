A song of ascents. I look up toward you, the one enthroned in heaven. 
Look, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a female servant look to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes will look to the Lord, our God, until he shows us favor.
Show us favor, O Lord, show us favor! For we have had our fill of humiliation, and then some. 
We have had our fill of the taunts of the self-assured, of the contempt of the proud.
