A musical composition by David, which he sang to the Lord concerning a Benjaminite named Cush. O Lord my God, in you I have taken shelter. Deliver me from all who chase me. Rescue me!
Otherwise they will rip me to shreds like a lion; they will tear me to bits and no one will be able to rescue me. 
O Lord my God, if I have done what they say, or am guilty of unjust actions,
or have wronged my ally, or helped his lawless enemy, 
may an enemy relentlessly chase me and catch me; may he trample me to death and leave me lying dishonored in the dust. (Selah)
Stand up angrily, Lord. Rise up with raging fury against my enemies. Wake up for my sake, and execute the judgment you have decreed for them.
The countries are assembled all around you; take once more your rightful place over them. 
The Lord judges the nations. Vindicate me, Lord, because I am innocent, because I am blameless, O Exalted One.
May the evil deeds of the wicked come to an end. But make the innocent secure, O righteous God, you who examine inner thoughts and motives. 
The Exalted God is my shield, the one who delivers the morally upright. 
God is a just judge; he is angry throughout the day. 
If a person does not repent, God will wield his sword. He has prepared to shoot his bow. 
He has prepared deadly weapons to use against him; he gets ready to shoot flaming arrows. 
See the one who is pregnant with wickedness, who conceives destructive plans, and gives birth to harmful lies—
he digs a pit and then falls into the hole he has made. 
He becomes the victim of his own destructive plans— and the violence he intended for others falls on his own head. 
I will thank the Lord for his justice; I will sing praises to the Lord Most High!
