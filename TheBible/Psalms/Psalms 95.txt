Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord. Let us shout out praises to our Protector who delivers us.
Let us enter his presence with thanksgiving. Let us shout out to him in celebration. 
For the Lord is a great God, a great king who is superior to all gods. 
The depths of the earth are in his hand, and the mountain peaks belong to him.
The sea is his, for he made it. His hands formed the dry land.
Come, let us bow down and worship. Let us kneel before the Lord, our Creator.
For he is our God; we are the people of his pasture, the sheep he owns. Today, if only you would obey him.
He says, “Do not be stubborn like they were at Meribah, like they were that day at Massah in the wilderness, 
where your ancestors challenged my authority and tried my patience, even though they had seen my work. 
For 40 years I was continually disgusted with that generation, and I said, ‘These people desire to go astray; they do not obey my commands.’ 
So I made a vow in my anger, ‘They will never enter into the resting place I had set aside for them.’”
