For the music director, by the Korahites; a psalm. All you nations, clap your hands. Shout out to God in celebration. 
For the Lord Most High is awe-inspiring; he is the great king who rules the whole earth! 
He subdued nations beneath us and countries under our feet. 
He picked out for us a special land to be a source of pride for Jacob, whom he loves. (Selah)
God has ascended his throne amid loud shouts; the Lord has ascended amid the blaring of ramâ€™s horns. 
Sing to God! Sing! Sing to our king! Sing! 
For God is king of the whole earth. Sing a well-written song.
God reigns over the nations. God sits on his holy throne. 
The nobles of the nations assemble, along with the people of the God of Abraham, for God has authority over the rulers of the earth. He is highly exalted.
