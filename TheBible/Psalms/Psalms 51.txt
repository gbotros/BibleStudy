For the music director, a psalm of David, written when Nathan the prophet confronted him after David’s affair with Bathsheba. Have mercy on me, O God, because of your loyal love. Because of your great compassion, wipe away my rebellious acts. 
Wash away my wrongdoing. Cleanse me of my sin. 
For I am aware of my rebellious acts; I am forever conscious of my sin. 
Against you—you above all—I have sinned; I have done what is evil in your sight. So you are just when you confront me; you are right when you condemn me.
Look, I was guilty of sin from birth, a sinner the moment my mother conceived me.
Look, you desire integrity in the inner man; you want me to possess wisdom. 
Cleanse me with hyssop and I will be pure; wash me and I will be whiter than snow. 
Grant me the ultimate joy of being forgiven. May the bones you crushed rejoice. 
Hide your face from my sins. Wipe away all my guilt. 
Create for me a pure heart, O God. Renew a resolute spirit within me.
Do not reject me. Do not take your Holy Spirit away from me.
Let me again experience the joy of your deliverance. Sustain me by giving me the desire to obey. 
Then I will teach rebels your merciful ways, and sinners will turn to you.
Rescue me from the guilt of murder, O God, the God who delivers me. Then my tongue will shout for joy because of your righteousness. 
O Lord, give me the words. Then my mouth will praise you.
Certainly you do not want a sacrifice, or else I would offer it; you do not desire a burnt sacrifice. 
The sacrifice God desires is a humble spirit— O God, a humble and repentant heart you will not reject. 
Because you favor Zion, do what is good for her. Fortify the walls of Jerusalem. 
Then you will accept the proper sacrifices, burnt sacrifices and whole offerings; then bulls will be sacrificed on your altar.
