I love the Lord because he heard my plea for mercy
and listened to me. As long as I live, I will call to him when I need help.
The ropes of death tightened around me, the snares of Sheol confronted me. I was confronted with trouble and sorrow. 
I called on the name of the Lord, “Please, Lord, rescue my life!” 
The Lord is merciful and fair; our God is compassionate. 
The Lord protects the untrained; I was in serious trouble and he delivered me.
Rest once more, my soul, for the Lord has vindicated you.
Yes, Lord, you rescued my life from death, kept my eyes from tears and my feet from stumbling. 
I will serve the Lord in the land of the living. 
I had faith when I said, “I am severely oppressed.” 
I rashly declared, “All men are liars.” 
How can I repay the Lord for all his acts of kindness to me?
I will celebrate my deliverance and call on the name of the Lord. 
I will fulfill my vows to the Lord before all his people. 
The Lord values the lives of his faithful followers. 
Yes, Lord! I am indeed your servant; I am your servant, the son of your female servant. You saved me from death.
I will present a thank offering to you, and call on the name of the Lord. 
I will fulfill my vows to the Lord before all his people, 
in the courts of the Lord’s temple, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord!
