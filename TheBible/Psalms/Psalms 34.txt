By David, when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech, causing the king to send him away. I will praise the Lord at all times; my mouth will continually praise him.
I will boast in the Lord; let the oppressed hear and rejoice. 
Magnify the Lord with me. Let us praise his name together. 
I sought the Lord’s help and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears. 
Look to him and be radiant; do not let your faces be ashamed. 
This oppressed man cried out and the Lord heard; he saved him from all his troubles. 
The angel of the Lord camps around the Lord’s loyal followers and delivers them.
Taste and see that the Lord is good. How blessed is the one who takes shelter in him.
Fear the Lord, you chosen people of his, for those who fear him lack nothing.
Even young lions sometimes lack food and are hungry, but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing. 
Come children. Listen to me. I will teach you what it means to fear the Lord. 
Do you want to really live? Would you love to live a long, happy life?
Then make sure you don’t speak evil words or use deceptive speech. 
Turn away from evil and do what is right. Strive for peace and promote it.
The Lord pays attention to the godly and hears their cry for help. 
But the Lord opposes evildoers and wipes out all memory of them from the earth. 
The godly cry out and the Lord hears; he saves them from all their troubles. 
The Lord is near the brokenhearted; he delivers those who are discouraged. 
The godly face many dangers, but the Lord saves them from each one of them.
He protects all his bones; not one of them is broken. 
Evil people self-destruct; those who hate the godly are punished. 
The Lord rescues his servants; all who take shelter in him escape punishment.
