A psalm of David, written to get God’s attention. O Lord, do not continue to rebuke me in your anger. Do not continue to punish me in your raging fury.
For your arrows pierce me, and your hand presses me down.
My whole body is sick because of your judgment; I am deprived of health because of my sin. 
For my sins overwhelm me; like a heavy load, they are too much for me to bear.
My wounds are infected and starting to smell, because of my foolish sins. 
I am dazed and completely humiliated; all day long I walk around mourning. 
For I am overcome with shame, and my whole body is sick. 
I am numb with pain and severely battered; I groan loudly because of the anxiety I feel. 
O Lord, you understand my heart’s desire; my groaning is not hidden from you.
My heart beats quickly; my strength leaves me. I can hardly see. 
Because of my condition, even my friends and acquaintances keep their distance; my neighbors stand far away. 
Those who seek my life try to entrap me; those who want to harm me speak destructive words. All day long they say deceitful things.
But I am like a deaf man—I hear nothing; I am like a mute who cannot speak. 
I am like a man who cannot hear and is incapable of arguing his defense. 
Yet I wait for you, O Lord! You will respond, O Lord, my God! 
I have prayed for deliverance, because otherwise they will gloat over me; when my foot slips they will arrogantly taunt me.
For I am about to stumble, and I am in constant pain. 
Yes, I confess my wrongdoing, and I am concerned about my sins. 
But those who are my enemies for no reason are numerous; those who hate me without cause outnumber me.
They repay me evil for the good I have done; though I have tried to do good to them, they hurl accusations at me. 
Do not abandon me, O Lord. My God, do not remain far away from me.
Hurry and help me, O Lord, my deliverer.
