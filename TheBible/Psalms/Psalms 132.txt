A song of ascents. O Lord, for David’s sake remember all his strenuous effort
and how he made a vow to the Lord, and swore an oath to the Powerful One of Jacob. 
He said, “I will not enter my own home, or get into my bed. 
I will not allow my eyes to sleep or my eyelids to slumber, 
until I find a place for the Lord, a fine dwelling place for the Powerful One of Jacob.” 
Look, we heard about it in Ephrathah; we found it in the territory of Jaar. 
Let us go to his dwelling place. Let us worship before his footstool. 
Ascend, O Lord, to your resting place, you and the ark of your strength. 
May your priests be clothed with integrity. May your loyal followers shout for joy.
For the sake of David, your servant, do not reject your chosen king. 
The Lord made a reliable promise to David; he will not go back on his word. He said, “I will place one of your descendants on your throne. 
If your sons keep my covenant and the rules I teach them, their sons will also sit on your throne forever.” 
Certainly the Lord has chosen Zion; he decided to make it his home. 
He said, “This will be my resting place forever; I will live here, for I have chosen it.
I will abundantly supply what she needs; I will give her poor all the food they need. 
I will protect her priests, and her godly people will shout exuberantly. 
There I will make David strong; I have determined that my chosen king’s dynasty will continue.
I will humiliate his enemies, and his crown will shine.”
