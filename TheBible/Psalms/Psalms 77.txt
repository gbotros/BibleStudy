For the music director, Jeduthun; a psalm of Asaph. I will cry out to God and call for help. I will cry out to God and he will pay attention to me. 
In my time of trouble I sought the Lord. I kept my hand raised in prayer throughout the night. I refused to be comforted. 
I said, “I will remember God while I groan; I will think about him while my strength leaves me.” (Selah)
You held my eyelids open; I was troubled and could not speak. 
I thought about the days of old, about ancient times. 
I said, “During the night I will remember the song I once sang; I will think very carefully.” I tried to make sense of what was happening. 
I asked, “Will the Lord reject me forever? Will he never again show me his favor? 
Has his loyal love disappeared forever? Has his promise failed forever? 
Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has his anger stifled his compassion?” (Selah)
Then I said, “I am sickened by the thought that the Most High might become inactive. 
I will remember the works of the Lord. Yes, I will remember the amazing things you did long ago. 
I will think about all you have done; I will reflect upon your deeds.” 
 O God, your deeds are extraordinary. What god can compare to our great God? 
You are the God who does amazing things; you have revealed your strength among the nations. 
You delivered your people by your strength— the children of Jacob and Joseph. (Selah)
The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you and trembled. Yes, the depths of the sea shook with fear.
The clouds poured down rain; the skies thundered. Yes, your arrows flashed about.
Your thunderous voice was heard in the wind; the lightning bolts lit up the world. The earth trembled and shook. 
You walked through the sea; you passed through the surging waters, but left no footprints. 
You led your people like a flock of sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
