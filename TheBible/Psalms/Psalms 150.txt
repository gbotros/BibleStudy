Praise the Lord! Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in the sky, which testifies to his strength! 
Praise him for his mighty acts; praise him for his surpassing greatness! 
Praise him with the blast of the horn; praise him with the lyre and the harp! 
Praise him with the tambourine and with dancing; praise him with stringed instruments and the flute! 
Praise him with loud cymbals; praise him with clanging cymbals! 
Let everything that has breath praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
