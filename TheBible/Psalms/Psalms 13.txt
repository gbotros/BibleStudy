For the music director, a psalm of David. How long, Lord, will you continue to ignore me? How long will you pay no attention to me?
How long must I worry, and suffer in broad daylight? How long will my enemy gloat over me?
Look at me! Answer me, O Lord my God! Revive me, or else I will die. 
Then my enemy will say, “I have defeated him.” Then my foes will rejoice because I am shaken. 
But I trust in your faithfulness. May I rejoice because of your deliverance. 
I will sing praises to the Lord when he vindicates me.
