Praise the Lord. Sing to the Lord a new song. Praise him in the assembly of the godly. 
Let Israel rejoice in their Creator. Let the people of Zion delight in their King.
Let them praise his name with dancing. Let them sing praises to him to the accompaniment of the tambourine and harp. 
For the Lord takes delight in his people; he exalts the oppressed by delivering them.
Let the godly rejoice because of their vindication. Let them shout for joy upon their beds. 
May the praises of God be in their mouths and a two-edged sword in their hands, 
in order to take revenge on the nations and punish foreigners. 
The godly bind their enemiesâ€™ kings in chains and their nobles in iron shackles, 
and execute the judgment to which their enemies have been sentenced. All his loyal followers will be vindicated. Praise the Lord.
