A song of ascents, by David. O Lord, my heart is not proud, nor do I have a haughty look. I do not have great aspirations, or concern myself with things that are beyond me. 
Indeed, I have calmed and quieted myself like a weaned child with its mother; I am content like a young child. 
O Israel, hope in the Lord now and forevermore!
