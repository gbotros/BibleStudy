By David. I will give you thanks with all my heart; before the heavenly assembly I will sing praises to you.
I will bow down toward your holy temple and give thanks to your name, because of your loyal love and faithfulness, for you have exalted your promise above the entire sky. 
When I cried out for help, you answered me. You made me bold and energized me.
Let all the kings of the earth give thanks to you, O Lord, when they hear the words you speak. 
Let them sing about the Lord’s deeds, for the Lord’s splendor is magnificent. 
Though the Lord is exalted, he looks after the lowly, and from far away humbles the proud. 
Even when I must walk in the midst of danger, you revive me. You oppose my angry enemies, and your right hand delivers me.
The Lord avenges me. O Lord, your loyal love endures. Do not abandon those whom you have made.
