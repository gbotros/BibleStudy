By David. Praise the Lord, O my soul. With all that is within me, praise his holy name. 
Praise the Lord, O my soul. Do not forget all his kind deeds. 
He is the one who forgives all your sins, who heals all your diseases, 
who delivers your life from the Pit, who crowns you with his loyal love and compassion, 
who satisfies your life with good things, so your youth is renewed like an eagle’s.
The Lord does what is fair, and executes justice for all the oppressed. 
The Lord revealed his faithful acts to Moses, his deeds to the Israelites. 
The Lord is compassionate and merciful; he is patient and demonstrates great loyal love. 
He does not always accuse and does not stay angry. 
He does not deal with us as our sins deserve; he does not repay us as our misdeeds deserve.
For as the skies are high above the earth, so his loyal love towers over his faithful followers. 
As far as the eastern horizon is from the west, so he removes the guilt of our rebellious actions from us. 
As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on his faithful followers. 
For he knows what we are made of; he realizes we are made of clay.
A person’s life is like grass. Like a flower in the field it flourishes, 
but when the hot wind blows, it disappears, and one can no longer even spot the place where it once grew.
But the Lord continually shows loyal love to his faithful followers and is faithful to their descendants, 
to those who keep his covenant, who are careful to obey his commands. 
The Lord has established his throne in heaven; his kingdom extends over everything. 
Praise the Lord, you angels of his, you powerful warriors who carry out his decrees and obey his orders. 
Praise the Lord, all you warriors of his, you servants of his who carry out his desires. 
Praise the Lord, all that he has made, in all the regions of his kingdom. Praise the Lord, O my soul.
