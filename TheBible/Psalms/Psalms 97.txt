The Lord reigns. Let the earth be happy. Let the many coastlands rejoice. 
Dark clouds surround him; equity and justice are the foundation of his throne. 
Fire goes before him; on every side it burns up his enemies. 
His lightning bolts light up the world; the earth sees and trembles. 
The mountains melt like wax before the Lord, before the Lord of the whole earth. 
The sky declares his justice, and all the nations see his splendor. 
All who worship idols are ashamed, those who boast about worthless idols. All the gods bow down before him.
Zion hears and rejoices, the towns of Judah are happy, because of your judgments, O Lord. 
For you, O Lord, are the Most High over the whole earth; you are elevated high above all gods. 
You who love the Lord, hate evil! He protects the lives of his faithful followers; he delivers them from the power of the wicked. 
The godly bask in the light; the morally upright experience joy. 
You godly ones, rejoice in the Lord. Give thanks to his holy name.
