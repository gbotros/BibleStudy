A song of ascents; by David. Look! How good and how pleasant it is when brothers truly live in unity. 
It is like fine oil poured on the head, which flows down the beard— Aaron’s beard, and then flows down his garments. 
It is like the dew of Hermon, which flows down upon the hills of Zion. Indeed, that is where the Lord has decreed a blessing will be available—eternal life.
