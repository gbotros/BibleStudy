For the music director, a well-written song by David. It was written when Doeg the Edomite went and informed Saul: “David has arrived at the home of Ahimelech.” Why do you boast about your evil plans, O powerful man? God’s loyal love protects me all day long.
Your tongue carries out your destructive plans; it is as effective as a sharp razor, O deceiver. 
You love evil more than good, lies more than speaking the truth. (Selah)
You love to use all the words that destroy, and the tongue that deceives. 
Yet God will make you a permanent heap of ruins. He will scoop you up and remove you from your home; he will uproot you from the land of the living. (Selah)
When the godly see this, they will be filled with awe, and will mock the evildoer, saying:
“Look, here is the man who would not make God his protector. He trusted in his great wealth and was confident about his plans to destroy others.” 
But I am like a flourishing olive tree in the house of God; I continually trust in God’s loyal love. 
I will continually thank you when you execute judgment; I will rely on you, for your loyal followers know you are good.
