A song of ascents. I look up toward the hills. From where does my help come? 
My help comes from the Lord, the Creator of heaven and earth. 
May he not allow your foot to slip. May your Protector not sleep. 
Look! Israelâ€™s Protector does not sleep or slumber. 
The Lord is your protector; the Lord is the shade at your right hand. 
The sun will not harm you by day, or the moon by night. 
The Lord will protect you from all harm; he will protect your life. 
The Lord will protect you in all you do, now and forevermore.
