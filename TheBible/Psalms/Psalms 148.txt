Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord from the sky. Praise him in the heavens. 
Praise him, all his angels. Praise him, all his heavenly assembly.
Praise him, O sun and moon. Praise him, all you shiny stars. 
Praise him, O highest heaven and you waters above the sky. 
Let them praise the name of the Lord, for he gave the command and they came into existence. 
He established them so they would endure; he issued a decree that will not be revoked.
Praise the Lord from the earth, you sea creatures and all you ocean depths, 
O fire and hail, snow and clouds, O stormy wind that carries out his orders, 
you mountains and all you hills, you fruit trees and all you cedars, 
you animals and all you cattle, you creeping things and birds, 
you kings of the earth and all you nations, you princes and all you leaders on the earth, 
you young men and young women, you elderly, along with you children. 
Let them praise the name of the Lord, for his name alone is exalted; his majesty extends over the earth and sky. 
He has made his people victorious and given all his loyal followers reason to praiseâ€” the Israelites, the people who are close to him. Praise the Lord!
