By David; a well-written song. How blessed is the one whose rebellious acts are forgiven, whose sin is pardoned. 
How blessed is the one whose wrongdoing the Lord does not punish, in whose spirit there is no deceit. 
When I refused to confess my sin, my whole body wasted away, while I groaned in pain all day long.
For day and night you tormented me; you tried to destroy me in the intense heat of summer. (Selah)
Then I confessed my sin; I no longer covered up my wrongdoing. I said, “I will confess my rebellious acts to the Lord.” And then you forgave my sins. (Selah)
For this reason every one of your faithful followers should pray to you while there is a window of opportunity. Certainly when the surging water rises, it will not reach them.
You are my hiding place; you protect me from distress. You surround me with shouts of joy from those celebrating deliverance. (Selah)
I will instruct and teach you about how you should live. I will advise you as I look you in the eye. 
Do not be like an unintelligent horse or mule, which will not obey you unless they are controlled by a bridle and bit. 
An evil person suffers much pain, but the Lord’s faithfulness overwhelms the one who trusts in him.
Rejoice in the Lord and be happy, you who are godly! Shout for joy, all you who are morally upright!
