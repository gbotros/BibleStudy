Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, O my soul. 
I will praise the Lord as long as I live. I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist. 
Do not trust in princes, or in human beings, who cannot deliver. 
Their lifeâ€™s breath departs, they return to the ground. On that day their plans die. 
How blessed is the one whose helper is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his God. 
The one who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, who remains forever faithful, 
vindicates the oppressed, and gives food to the hungry. The Lord releases the imprisoned. 
The Lord gives sight to the blind. The Lord lifts up all who are bent over. The Lord loves the godly. 
The Lord protects the resident foreigner. He lifts up the fatherless and the widow, but he opposes the wicked. 
The Lord rules forever, your God, O Zion, throughout the generations to come. Praise the Lord!
