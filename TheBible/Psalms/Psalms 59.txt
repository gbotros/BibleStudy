For the music director, according to the al-tashcheth style; a prayer of David, written when Saul sent men to surround his house and murder him. Deliver me from my enemies, my God. Protect me from those who attack me.
Deliver me from evildoers. Rescue me from violent men. 
For look, they wait to ambush me; powerful men stalk me, but not because I have rebelled or sinned, O Lord. 
Though I have done nothing wrong, they are anxious to attack. Spring into action and help me. Take notice of me.
You, O Lord God of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, rouse yourself and punish all the nations. Have no mercy on any treacherous evildoers. (Selah)
They return in the evening; they growl like dogs and prowl around outside the city. 
Look, they hurl insults at me and openly threaten to kill me, for they say, “Who hears?” 
But you, O Lord, laugh in disgust at them; you taunt all the nations. 
You are my source of strength. I will wait for you. For God is my refuge. 
The God who loves me will help me; God will enable me to triumph over my enemies.
Do not strike them dead suddenly, because then my people might forget the lesson. Use your power to make them homeless vagabonds and then bring them down, O Lord who shields us.
They speak sinful words. So let them be trapped by their own pride and by the curses and lies they speak. 
Angrily wipe them out. Wipe them out so they vanish. Let them know that God rules over Jacob and to the ends of the earth. (Selah)
They return in the evening; they growl like dogs and prowl around outside the city. 
They wander around looking for something to eat; they refuse to sleep until they are full. 
As for me, I will sing about your strength; I will praise your loyal love in the morning. For you are my refuge and my place of shelter when I face trouble. 
You are my source of strength. I will sing praises to you. For God is my refuge, the God who loves me.
