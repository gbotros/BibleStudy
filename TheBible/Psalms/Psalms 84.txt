For the music director, according to the gittith style; written by the Korahites, a psalm. How lovely is the place where you live, O Lord of Heaven’s Armies! 
I desperately want to be in the courts of the Lord’s temple. My heart and my entire being shout for joy to the living God. 
Even the birds find a home there, and the swallow builds a nest where she can protect her young near your altars, O Lord of Heaven’s Armies, my King and my God. 
How blessed are those who live in your temple and praise you continually. (Selah)
How blessed are those who find their strength in you and long to travel the roads that lead to your temple.
As they pass through the Baca Valley, he provides a spring for them. The rain even covers it with pools of water. 
They are sustained as they travel along; each one appears before God in Zion. 
O Lord God of Heaven’s Armies, hear my prayer. Listen, O God of Jacob. (Selah)
O God, take notice of our shield. Show concern for your chosen king. 
Certainly spending just one day in your temple courts is better than spending a thousand elsewhere. I would rather stand at the entrance to the temple of my God than live in the tents of the wicked. 
For the Lord God is our sovereign protector. The Lord bestows favor and honor; he withholds no good thing from those who have integrity. 
O Lord of Heaven’s Armies, how blessed are those who trust in you.
