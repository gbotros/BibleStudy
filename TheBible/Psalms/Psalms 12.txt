For the music director, according to the sheminith style; a psalm of David. Deliver, Lord! For the godly have disappeared; people of integrity have vanished. 
People lie to one another; they flatter and deceive. 
May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that boasts! 
They say, “We speak persuasively; we know how to flatter and boast. Who is our master?” 
“Because of the violence done to the oppressed, because of the painful cries of the needy, I will spring into action,” says the Lord. “I will provide the safety they so desperately desire.” 
The Lord’s words are absolutely reliable. They are as untainted as silver purified in a furnace on the ground, where it is thoroughly refined. 
You, Lord, will protect the oppressed; you will continually shelter each one from these evil people, 
for the wicked seem to be everywhere, when people promote evil.
