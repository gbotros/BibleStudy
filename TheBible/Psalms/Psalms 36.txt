For the music director, an oracle, written by the Lordâ€™s servant David. An evil man is rebellious to the core. He does not fear God, 
for he is too proud to recognize and give up his sin. 
The words he speaks are sinful and deceitful; he does not care about doing what is wise and right.
While he lies in bed he plans ways to sin. He is committed to a sinful lifestyle; he does not reject what is evil. 
O Lord, your loyal love reaches to the sky, your faithfulness to the clouds. 
Your justice is like the highest mountains, your fairness like the deepest sea; you, Lord, preserve mankind and the animal kingdom. 
How precious is your loyal love, O God! The human race finds shelter under your wings. 
They are filled with food from your house, and you allow them to drink from the river of your delicacies. 
For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light. 
Extend your loyal love to your faithful followers, and vindicate the morally upright. 
Do not let arrogant men overtake me, or let evil men make me homeless. 
I can see the evildoers! They have fallen. They have been knocked down and are unable to get up.
