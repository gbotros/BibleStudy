For the music director, written by the Korahites, a psalm. O Lord, you showed favor to your land; you restored the well-being of Jacob. 
You pardoned the wrongdoing of your people; you forgave all their sin. (Selah)
You withdrew all your fury; you turned back from your raging anger. 
Restore us, O God our deliverer. Do not be displeased with us.
Will you stay mad at us forever? Will you remain angry throughout future generations? 
Will you not revive us once more? Then your people will rejoice in you. 
O Lord, show us your loyal love. Bestow on us your deliverance. 
I will listen to what God the Lord says. For he will make peace with his people, his faithful followers. Yet they must not return to their foolish ways.
Certainly his loyal followers will soon experience his deliverance; then his splendor will again appear in our land. 
Loyal love and faithfulness meet; deliverance and peace greet each other with a kiss. 
Faithfulness grows from the ground, and deliverance looks down from the sky. 
Yes, the Lord will bestow his good blessings, and our land will yield its crops. 
Deliverance goes before him, and prepares a pathway for him.
