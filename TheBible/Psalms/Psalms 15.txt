A psalm of David. Lord, who may be a guest in your home? Who may live on your holy hill? 
Whoever lives a blameless life, does what is right, and speaks honestly. 
He does not slander, or do harm to others, or insult his neighbor. 
He despises a reprobate, but honors the Lordâ€™s loyal followers. He makes firm commitments and does not renege on his promise. 
He does not charge interest when he lends his money. He does not take bribes to testify against the innocent. The one who lives like this will never be shaken.
