For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a psalm of David. When I call out, answer me, O God who vindicates me. Though I am hemmed in, you will lead me into a wide, open place. Have mercy on me and respond to my prayer. 
You men, how long will you try to turn my honor into shame? How long will you love what is worthless and search for what is deceptive? (Selah)
Realize that the Lord shows the godly special favor; the Lord responds when I cry out to him. 
Tremble with fear and do not sin. Meditate as you lie in bed, and repent of your ways. (Selah)
Offer the prescribed sacrifices and trust in the Lord. 
Many say, “Who can show us anything good?” Smile upon us, Lord! 
You make me happier than those who have abundant grain and wine. 
I will lie down and sleep peacefully, for you, Lord, make me safe and secure.
