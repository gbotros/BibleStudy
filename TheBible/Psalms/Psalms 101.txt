A psalm of David. I will sing about loyalty and justice. To you, O Lord, I will sing praises. 
I will walkin the way of integrity. When will you come to me? I will conduct my business with integrity in the midst of my palace. 
I will not even consider doing what is dishonest. I hate doing evil; I will have no part of it.
I will have nothing to do with a perverse person; I will not permit evil. 
I will destroy anyone who slanders his neighbor in secret. I will not tolerate anyone who has a haughty demeanor and an arrogant attitude. 
I will favor the honest people of the land and allow them to live with me. Those who walk in the way of integrity will attend me. 
Deceitful people will not live in my palace. Liars will not be welcome in my presence. 
Each morning I will destroy all the wicked people in the land and remove all evildoers from the city of the Lord.
