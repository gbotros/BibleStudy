A psalm of David. O Lord, hear my prayer. Pay attention to my plea for help. Because of your faithfulness and justice, answer me.
Do not sit in judgment on your servant, for no one alive is innocent before you.
Certainly my enemies chase me. They smash me into the ground. They force me to live in dark regions, like those who have been dead for ages. 
My strength leaves me; I am absolutely shocked. 
I recall the old days. I meditate on all you have done; I reflect on your accomplishments.
I spread my hands out to you in prayer; my soul thirsts for you in a parched land.(Selah) 
Answer me quickly, Lord. My strength is fading. Do not reject me, or I will join those descending into the grave. 
May I hear about your loyal love in the morning, for I trust in you. Show me the way I should go, because I long for you. 
Rescue me from my enemies, O Lord. I run to you for protection. 
Teach me to do what pleases you, for you are my God. May your kind presence lead me into a level land. 
O Lord, for the sake of your reputation, revive me. Because of your justice, rescue me from trouble. 
As a demonstration of your loyal love, destroy my enemies. Annihilate all who threaten my life, for I am your servant.
