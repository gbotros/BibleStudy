A psalm of Asaph. O God, foreigners have invaded your chosen land; they have polluted your holy temple and turned Jerusalem into a heap of ruins. 
They have given the corpses of your servants to the birds of the sky, the flesh of your loyal followers to the beasts of the earth. 
They have made their blood flow like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury them.
We have become an object of disdain to our neighbors; those who live on our borders taunt and insult us.
How long will this go on, O Lord? Will you stay angry forever? How long will your rage burn like fire? 
Pour out your anger on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that do not pray to you. 
For they have devoured Jacob and destroyed his home. 
Do not hold us accountable for the sins of earlier generations. Quickly send your compassion our way, for we are in serious trouble.
Help us, O God, our deliverer! For the sake of your glorious reputation, rescue us. Forgive our sins for the sake of your reputation. 
Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Before our very eyes may the shed blood of your servants be avenged among the nations. 
Listen to the painful cries of the prisoners. Use your great strength to set free those condemned to die. 
Pay back our neighbors in full. May they be insulted the same way they insulted you, O Lord. 
Then we, your people, the sheep of your pasture, will continually thank you. We will tell coming generations of your praiseworthy acts.
