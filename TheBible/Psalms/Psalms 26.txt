By David. Vindicate me, O Lord, for I have integrity, and I trust in the Lord without wavering. 
Examine me, O Lord, and test me. Evaluate my inner thoughts and motives. 
For I am ever aware of your faithfulness, and your loyalty continually motivates me.
I do not associate with deceitful men, or consort with those who are dishonest. 
I hate the mob of evil men, and do not associate with the wicked. 
I maintain a pure lifestyle, so I can appear before your altar, O Lord, 
to give you thanks, and to tell about all your amazing deeds.
O Lord, I love the temple where you live, the place where your splendor is revealed. 
Do not sweep me away with sinners, or execute me along with violent people, 
who are always ready to do wrong or offer a bribe. 
But I have integrity. Rescue me and have mercy on me!
I am safe, and among the worshipers I will praise the Lord.
