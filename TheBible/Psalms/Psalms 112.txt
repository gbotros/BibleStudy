Praise the Lord! How blessed is the one who obeys the Lord, who takes great delight in keeping his commands. 
His descendants will be powerful on the earth; the godly will be blessed. 
His house contains wealth and riches; his integrity endures. 
In the darkness a light shines for the godly, for each one who is merciful, compassionate, and just. 
It goes well for the one who generously lends money and conducts his business honestly.
For he will never be shaken; others will always remember one who is just. 
He does not fear bad news. He is confident; he trusts in the Lord. 
His resolve is firm; he will not succumb to fear before he looks in triumph on his enemies. 
He generously gives to the needy; his integrity endures. He will be vindicated and honored. 
When the wicked see this, they will worry; they will grind their teeth in frustration and melt away. The desire of the wicked will perish.
