Praise the Lord. Praise the name of the Lord. Offer praise, you servants of the Lord, 
who serve in the Lord’s temple, in the courts of the temple of our God. 
Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good. Sing praises to his name, for it is pleasant. 
Indeed, the Lord has chosen Jacob for himself, Israel to be his special possession. 
Yes, I know the Lord is great, and our Lord is superior to all gods. 
He does whatever he pleases in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all the ocean depths. 
He causes the clouds to arise from the end of the earth, makes lightning bolts accompany the rain, and brings the wind out of his storehouses. 
He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, including both men and animals. 
He performed awesome deeds and acts of judgment in your midst, O Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants. 
He defeated many nations, and killed mighty kings—
Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan. 
He gave their land as an inheritance, as an inheritance to Israel his people. 
O Lord, your name endures, your reputation, O Lord, lasts. 
For the Lord vindicates his people and has compassion on his servants. 
The nations’ idols are made of silver and gold; they are man-made.
They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see, 
and ears, but cannot hear. Indeed, they cannot breathe. 
Those who make them will end up like them, as will everyone who trusts in them.
O family of Israel, praise the Lord. O family of Aaron, praise the Lord. 
O family of Levi, praise the Lord. You loyal followers of the Lord, praise the Lord. 
The Lord deserves praise in Zion— he who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise the Lord.
