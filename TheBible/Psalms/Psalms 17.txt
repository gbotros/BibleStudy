A prayer of David. Lord, consider my just cause. Pay attention to my cry for help. Listen to the prayer I sincerely offer. 
Make a just decision on my behalf. Decide what is right.
You have scrutinized my inner motives; you have examined me during the night. You have carefully evaluated me, but you find no sin. I am determined I will say nothing sinful. 
As for the actions of peopleâ€” just as you have commanded, I have not followed in the footsteps of violent men. 
I carefully obey your commands; I do not deviate from them.
I call to you because you will answer me, O God. Listen to me! Hear what I say! 
Accomplish awesome, faithful deeds, you who powerfully deliver those who look to you for protection from their enemies.
Protect me as you would protect the pupil of your eye. Hide me in the shadow of your wings. 
Protect me from the wicked men who attack me, my enemies who crowd around me for the kill.
They are calloused; they speak arrogantly. 
They attack me, now they surround me; they intend to throw me to the ground. 
He is like a lion that wants to tear its prey to bits, like a young lion crouching in hidden places. 
Rise up, Lord! Confront him. Knock him down. Use your sword to rescue me from the wicked man.
Lord, use your power to deliver me from these murderers, from the murderers of this world. They enjoy prosperity; you overwhelm them with the riches they desire. They have many children, and leave their wealth to their offspring. 
As for me, because I am innocent I will see your face; when I awake you will reveal yourself to me.
