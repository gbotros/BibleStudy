For the music director, by David. Fools say to themselves, “There is no God.” They sin and commit evil deeds; none of them does what is right. 
The Lord looks down from heaven at the human race, to see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks God. 
Everyone rejects God; they are all morally corrupt. None of them does what is right, not even one. 
All those who behave wickedly do not understand— those who devour my people as if they were eating bread and do not call out to the Lord. 
They are absolutely terrified, for God defends the godly. 
You want to humiliate the oppressed, even though the Lord is their shelter. 
I wish the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion! When the Lord restores the well-being of his people, may Jacob rejoice, may Israel be happy!
