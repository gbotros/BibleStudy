A prayer of David. Listen, O Lord. Answer me. For I am oppressed and needy. 
Protect me, for I am loyal. You are my God; deliver your servant who trusts in you.
Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I cry out to you all day long.
Make your servant glad, for to you, O Lord, I pray. 
Certainly, O Lord, you are kind and forgiving, and show great faithfulness to all who cry out to you.
O Lord, hear my prayer. Pay attention to my plea for mercy. 
In my time of trouble I cry out to you, for you will answer me.
None can compare to you among the gods, O Lord. Your exploits are incomparable. 
All the nations, whom you created, will come and worship you, O Lord. They will honor your name. 
For you are great and do amazing things. You alone are God. 
O Lord, teach me how you want me to live. Then I will obey your commands. Make me wholeheartedly committed to you.
O Lord, my God, I will give you thanks with my whole heart. I will honor your name continually. 
For you will extend your great loyal love to me and will deliver my life from the depths of Sheol. 
O God, arrogant men attack me; a gang of ruthless men, who do not respect you, seek my life. 
But you, O Lord, are a compassionate and merciful God. You are patient and demonstrate great loyal love and faithfulness. 
Turn toward me and have mercy on me. Give your servant your strength. Deliver this son of your female servant. 
Show me evidence of your favor. Then those who hate me will see it and be ashamed, for you, O Lord, will help me and comfort me.
