A well-written song by David, when he was in the cave; a prayer. To the Lord I cry out; to the Lord I plead for mercy. 
I pour out my lament before him; I tell him about my troubles. 
Even when my strength leaves me, you watch my footsteps. In the path where I walk they have hidden a trap for me.
Look to the right and see. No one cares about me. I have nowhere to run; no one is concerned about my life. 
I cry out to you, O Lord; I say, “You are my shelter, my security in the land of the living.” 
Listen to my cry for help, for I am in serious trouble. Rescue me from those who chase me, for they are stronger than I am.
Free me from prison that I may give thanks to your name. Because of me the godly will assemble, for you will vindicate me.
