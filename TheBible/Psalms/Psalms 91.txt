As for you, the one who lives in the shelter of the Most High, and resides in the protective shadow of the Sovereign One—
I say this about the Lord, my shelter and my stronghold, my God in whom I trust—
he will certainly rescue you from the snare of the hunter and from the destructive plague. 
He will shelter you with his wings; you will find safety under his wings. His faithfulness is like a shield or a protective wall. 
You need not fear the terrors of the night, the arrow that flies by day, 
the plague that stalks in the darkness, or the disease that ravages at noon. 
Though a thousand may fall beside you, and a multitude on your right side, it will not reach you.
Certainly you will see it with your very own eyes— you will see the wicked paid back. 
For you have taken refuge in the Lord, my shelter, the Most High.
No harm will overtake you; no illness will come near your home. 
For he will order his angels to protect you in all you do. 
They will lift you up in their hands, so you will not slip and fall on a stone. 
You will subdue a lion and a snake; you will trample underfoot a young lion and a serpent. 
The Lord says, “Because he is devoted to me, I will deliver him; I will protect him because he is loyal to me. 
When he calls out to me, I will answer him. I will be with him when he is in trouble; I will rescue him and bring him honor. 
I will satisfy him with long life and will let him see my salvation.”
