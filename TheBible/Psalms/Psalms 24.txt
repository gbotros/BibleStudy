A psalm of David. The Lord owns the earth and all it contains, the world and all who live in it.
For he set its foundation upon the seas, and established it upon the ocean currents. 
Who is allowed to ascend the mountain of the Lord? Who may go up to his holy dwelling place? 
The one whose deeds are blameless and whose motives are pure, who does not lie, or make promises with no intention of keeping them.
Such godly people are rewarded by the Lord, and vindicated by the God who delivers them.
Such purity characterizes the people who seek his favor, Jacob’s descendants, who pray to him. (Selah)
Look up, you gates. Rise up, you eternal doors. Then the majestic king will enter. 
Who is this majestic king? The Lord who is strong and mighty. The Lord who is mighty in battle. 
Look up, you gates. Rise up, you eternal doors. Then the majestic king will enter. 
Who is this majestic king? The Lord of Heaven’s Armies. He is the majestic king. (Selah)
