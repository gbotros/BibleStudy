For the music director, a psalm of David. I relied completely on the Lord, and he turned toward me and heard my cry for help. 
He lifted me out of the watery pit, out of the slimy mud. He placed my feet on a rock and gave me secure footing. 
He gave me reason to sing a new song, praising our God. May many see what God has done, so that they might swear allegiance to him and trust in the Lord. 
How blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord and does not seek help from the proud or from liars. 
O Lord, my God, you have accomplished many things; you have done amazing things and carried out your purposes for us. No one can thwart you. I want to declare your deeds and talk about them, but they are too numerous to recount. 
Receiving sacrifices and offerings are not your primary concern. You make that quite clear to me. You do not ask for burnt sacrifices and sin offerings. 
Then I say, “Look, I come! What is written in the scroll pertains to me.
I want to do what pleases you, my God. Your law dominates my thoughts.” 
I have told the great assembly about your justice. Look, I spare no words. O Lord, you know this is true.
I have not failed to tell about your justice; I spoke about your reliability and deliverance. I have not neglected to tell the great assembly about your loyal love and faithfulness. 
O Lord, you do not withhold your compassion from me. May your loyal love and faithfulness continually protect me!
For innumerable dangers surround me. My sins overtake me so I am unable to see; they outnumber the hairs of my head so my strength fails me.
Please be willing, O Lord, to rescue me! O Lord, hurry and help me!
May those who are trying to snatch away my life be totally embarrassed and ashamed. May those who want to harm me be turned back and ashamed. 
May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” be humiliated and disgraced. 
May all those who seek you be happy and rejoice in you. May those who love to experience your deliverance say continually, “May the Lord be praised!” 
I am oppressed and needy. May the Lord pay attention to me. You are my helper and my deliverer. O my God, do not delay.
