A song of ascents. From the deep water I cry out to you, O Lord. 
O Lord, listen to me. Pay attention to my plea for mercy.
If you, O Lord, were to keep track of sins, O Lord, who could stand before you?
But you are willing to forgive so that you might be honored. 
I rely on the Lord. I rely on him with my whole being; I wait for his assuring word. 
I yearn for the Lord, more than watchmen do for the morning, yes, more than watchmen do for the morning. 
O Israel, hope in the Lord, for the Lord exhibits loyal love and is more than willing to deliver. 
He will deliver Israel from all their sins.
