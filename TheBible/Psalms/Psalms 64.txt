For the music director, a psalm of David. Listen to me, O God, as I offer my lament! Protect my life from the enemy’s terrifying attacks.
Hide me from the plots of evil men, from the crowd of evildoers. 
They sharpen their tongues like swords; they aim their arrows, a slanderous charge, 
in order to shoot down the innocent in secluded places. They shoot at him suddenly and are unafraid of retaliation. 
They encourage one another to carry out their evil deed. They plan how to hide snares and boast, “Who will see them?”
They devise unjust schemes; they disguise a well-conceived plot. Man’s inner thoughts cannot be discovered.
But God will shoot at them; suddenly they will be wounded by an arrow. 
Their slander will bring about their demise. All who see them will shudder, 
and all people will fear. They will proclaim what God has done, and reflect on his deeds. 
The godly will rejoice in the Lord and take shelter in him. All the morally upright will boast.
