Sing to the Lord a new song. Sing to the Lord, all the earth. 
Sing to the Lord. Praise his name. Announce every day how he delivers. 
Tell the nations about his splendor. Tell all the nations about his amazing deeds.
For the Lord is great and certainly worthy of praise; he is more awesome than all gods. 
For all the gods of the nations are worthless, but the Lord made the sky. 
Majestic splendor emanates from him; his sanctuary is firmly established and beautiful. 
Ascribe to the Lord, O families of the nations, ascribe to the Lord splendor and strength. 
Ascribe to the Lord the splendor he deserves. Bring an offering and enter his courts. 
Worship the Lord in holy attire. Tremble before him, all the earth. 
Say among the nations, “The Lord reigns! The world is established; it cannot be moved. He judges the nations fairly.” 
Let the sky rejoice, and the earth be happy. Let the sea and everything in it shout.
Let the fields and everything in them celebrate. Then let the trees of the forest shout with joy
before the Lord, for he comes. For he comes to judge the earth. He judges the world fairly and the nations in accordance with his justice.
