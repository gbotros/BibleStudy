A song of ascents. When the Lord restored the well-being of Zion, we thought we were dreaming. 
At that time we laughed loudly and shouted for joy. At that time the nations said, “The Lord has accomplished great things for these people.”
The Lord did indeed accomplish great things for us. We were happy. 
O Lord, restore our well-being, just as the streams in the arid south are replenished.
Those who shed tears as they plant will shout for joy when they reap the harvest.
The one who weeps as he walks along, carrying his bag of seed, will certainly come in with a shout of joy, carrying his sheaves of grain.
