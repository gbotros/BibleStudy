A psalm of David, written when he was in the Judean wilderness. O God, you are my God. I long for you. My soul thirsts for you, my flesh yearns for you, in a dry and parched land where there is no water. 
Yes, in the sanctuary I have seen you, and witnessed your power and splendor. 
Because experiencing your loyal love is better than life itself, my lips will praise you.
For this reason I will praise you while I live; in your name I will lift up my hands. 
As with choice meat you satisfy my soul. My mouth joyfully praises you,
whenever I remember you on my bed, and think about you during the nighttime hours. 
For you are my deliverer; under your wings I rejoice. 
My soul pursues you; your right hand upholds me.
Enemies seek to destroy my life, but they will descend into the depths of the earth. 
Each one will be handed over to the sword; their corpses will be eaten by jackals. 
But the king will rejoice in God; everyone who takes oaths in his name will boast, for the mouths of those who speak lies will be shut up.
