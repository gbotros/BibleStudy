A psalm of Asaph. God stands in the assembly of El; in the midst of the gods he renders judgment. 
He says, “How long will you make unjust legal decisions and show favoritism to the wicked? (Selah)
Defend the cause of the poor and the fatherless. Vindicate the oppressed and suffering. 
Rescue the poor and needy. Deliver them from the power of the wicked. 
They neither know nor understand. They stumble around in the dark, while all the foundations of the earth crumble. 
I thought, ‘You are gods; all of you are sons of the Most High.’
Yet you will die like mortals; you will fall like all the other rulers.” 
Rise up, O God, and execute judgment on the earth! For you own all the nations.
