For the music director, Jeduthun; a psalm of David. For God alone I patiently wait; he is the one who delivers me. 
He alone is my protector and deliverer. He is my refuge; I will not be upended. 
How long will you threaten a man like me? All of you are murderers, as dangerous as a leaning wall or an unstable fence. 
They spend all their time planning how to bring their victim down. They love to use deceit; they pronounce blessings with their mouths, but inwardly they utter curses. (Selah)
Patiently wait for God alone, my soul! For he is the one who gives me hope. 
He alone is my protector and deliverer. He is my refuge; I will not be shaken. 
God delivers me and exalts me; God is my strong protector and my shelter. 
Trust in him at all times, you people! Pour out your hearts before him. God is our shelter. (Selah)
Men are nothing but a mere breath; human beings are unreliable. When they are weighed in the scales, all of them together are lighter than air. 
Do not trust in what you can gain by oppression. Do not put false confidence in what you can gain by robbery. If wealth increases, do not become attached to it.
God has declared one principle; two principles I have heard: God is strong, 
and you, O Lord, demonstrate loyal love. For you repay men for what they do.
