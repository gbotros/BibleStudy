For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a well-written song by David. It was written when the Ziphites came and informed Saul: “David is hiding with us.” O God, deliver me by your name. Vindicate me by your power. 
O God, listen to my prayer. Pay attention to what I say. 
For foreigners attack me; ruthless men, who do not respect God, seek my life. (Selah)
Look, God is my deliverer. The Lord is among those who support me. 
May those who wait to ambush me be repaid for their evil. As a demonstration of your faithfulness, destroy them.
With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you. I will give thanks to your name, O Lord, for it is good. 
Surely he rescues me from all trouble, and I triumph over my enemies.
