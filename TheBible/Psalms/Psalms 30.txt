A psalm, a song used at the dedication of the temple; by David. I will praise you, O Lord, for you lifted me up and did not allow my enemies to gloat over me.
O Lord my God, I cried out to you and you healed me.
O Lord, you pulled me up from Sheol; you rescued me from among those descending into the grave.
Sing to the Lord, you faithful followers of his; give thanks to his holy name. 
For his anger lasts only a brief moment, and his good favor restores one’s life. One may experience sorrow during the night, but joy arrives in the morning. 
In my self-confidence I said, “I will never be shaken.” 
O Lord, in your good favor you made me secure. Then you rejected me and I was terrified. 
To you, O Lord, I cried out; I begged the Lord for mercy: 
“What profit is there in taking my life, in my descending into the Pit? Can the dust of the grave praise you? Can it declare your loyalty? 
Hear, O Lord, and have mercy on me. O Lord, deliver me.”
Then you turned my lament into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and covered me with joy. 
So now my heart will sing to you and not be silent; O Lord my God, I will always give thanks to you.
