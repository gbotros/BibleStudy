When Israel left Egypt, when the family of Jacob left a foreign nation behind, 
Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his kingdom. 
The sea looked and fled; the Jordan River turned back. 
The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs. 
Why do you flee, O sea? Why do you turn back, O Jordan River? 
Why do you skip like rams, O mountains, like lambs, O hills? 
Tremble, O earth, before the Lordâ€” before the God of Jacob, 
who turned a rock into a pool of water, a hard rock into springs of water.
