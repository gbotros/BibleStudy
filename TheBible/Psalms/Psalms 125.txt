A song of ascents. Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved and will endure forever. 
As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the Lord surrounds his people, now and forevermore. 
Indeed, the scepter of a wicked king will not settle upon the allotted land of the godly. Otherwise the godly might do what is wrong. 
Do good, O Lord, to those who are good, to the morally upright. 
As for those who are bent on traveling a sinful path, may the Lord remove them, along with those who behave wickedly. May Israel experience peace.
