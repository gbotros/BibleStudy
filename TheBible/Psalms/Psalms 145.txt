A psalm of praise; by David. I will extol you, my God, O King. I will praise your name continually. 
Every day I will praise you. I will praise your name continually. 
The Lord is great and certainly worthy of praise. No one can fathom his greatness. 
One generation will praise your deeds to another and tell about your mighty acts.
I will focus on your honor and majestic splendor and your amazing deeds. 
They will proclaim the power of your awesome acts. I will declare your great deeds. 
They will talk about the fame of your great kindness and sing about your justice. 
The Lord is merciful and compassionate; he is patient and demonstrates great loyal love. 
The Lord is good to all and has compassion on all he has made. 
All your works will give thanks to you, Lord. Your loyal followers will praise you.
They will proclaim the splendor of your kingdom; they will tell about your power, 
so that mankind might acknowledge your mighty acts and the majestic splendor of your kingdom. 
Your kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and your dominion endures through all generations. 
 The Lord supports all who fall and lifts up all who are bent over.
Everything looks to you in anticipation, and you provide them with food on a regular basis. 
You open your hand and fill every living thing with the food it desires. 
The Lord is just in all his actions and exhibits love in all he does. 
The Lord is near all who cry out to him, all who cry out to him sincerely. 
He satisfies the desire of his loyal followers; he hears their cry for help and delivers them.
The Lord protects all those who love him, but he destroys all the wicked. 
My mouth will praise the Lord. Let all who live praise his holy name forever.
